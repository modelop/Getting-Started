ask if a percept is right correct true veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory. but it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false. on the other hand it is strange to ask whether a

training altitude to the equivalent altitude on mount everest where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak without oxygen tanks. this is quite a feat of physiological endurance because if
