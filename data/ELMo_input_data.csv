1,some big deletions another in a string of idiotic generalizations. gad i'm surprised i got this far down in the post. i guess some just like seeing their names up on a crt. like me phil trodwell,0
2,you should wear your nicest boxer shorts and bring plenty of spf sunscreen. i'll grab my bathing suit towerl and some veggie hotdogs and we can have bonfire cookout does that sound good enough to you dean every a.a poster is invited,0
3,you can tell your friend from me that i was in a publisher's warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of the joy of cooking and every one of them was syllableperfect. i have since sold all i own and become a follower of the joy of cooking. the incident i mentioned convinced me once and for all that the joy of cooking is inspired by god and the one true path to his glory.,0
4,false dichotomy. you claimed the killing were not religiously motivated and i'm saying that's wrong. i'm not saying that each and every killing is religiously motivate as i spelled out in detail. which killings do you say are religously motivated for example i would claim that the recent assassination of four catholic construction workers who had no connection with the ira was probably religously motivated. at the time of writing i think that someone who claims the current violence is motivated by religion is reaching. what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n.i are not religously motivated i'd say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge and by misguided patriotism. otherwise i'd have to wonder how come mainland catholics are not killed by mainland protestants and southern catholics are not killed by southern protestants and so on. take away all plausible causes bar religion and the violence diminishes markedly. gee why is that now it's possible to argue that religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in the present but i don't know of any evidence that this is so and i'm not enough of a historian to debate it. given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland into a country that has a particular church written into its constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated by that church i fail to see why the word past is appropriate. the country also has a different official language written in its constitution and vice versa maybe they're motivated by a love of irish poetry. your argument is fallacious jon. for what it's worth i agree with all that you say about ireland above and more.,0
5,i recall a discussion i had heard years ago. it went something like this the problem with omnipotence at least as i perceive it as personified by the christian god ideal is that it is potentially contradictory. if a manifestation such as god is truly infinite in power can god place limits upon itself . . some stuff i can't recall. then some other questions i think i recall correctly can god unmake itself can god make itself assuming it doesn't yet exist has god has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of gods potential quantum states into reality was god nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during the earliest stages of universal inflationary creation is god a vacuum fluctuation given a great enough energy density could we recreate god would that make us god and god something else . . some more stuff i don't recall concerning creating god. followed by is god selfaware is it necessary that god be selfaware is god a living entity is it necessay that god be a living entity is god unchanging or does it evolve . . any comments post them so that others might benefit from the open inquiry and resulting discussion.,0
6,...details of us built chemical plant at al alteer near baghdad... however the plant's intended use was to aid the iraqi infrastructure. it is not an example of selling a weapon. may sound nitpicking but are we going to refuse to sell valuable parts that build the infrastructure because of dual use technology i am contending that in this case and in the case of the sale of pesticides by uk companies that they knew full well that it was to be used for the production of chemical weapons even if that was not its officially stated purpose. i personally don't think that letting iran conquer iraq would have been a good thing. for that matter neither do i for the reasons you state. it is the hypocrisy and claims the us did not help iraq that make me angry plus the fact that the usa seems to believe it has the right to interfere where is sees fit i.e. has an interest rather than a duty to intervene where it is required. this is demonstrated by the failure of the us to do anything about east timor and the region is becoming destabilised. the usa might have done something approaching the right thing given my reservations about the uncessary number of civillian casualites but for wholly the wrong reasons and after having a hand in creating the situation. that in no way would affect the us later military action against iraq. i did not suggest it would and it would be ridiculous to assert otherwise. i was simply indicating the usa has previously aided iraq. intel on manufacturing techniques or something of that nature no apparently data orginally from satellites although i doubt that iraq would have been given the raw data concerning troop concentrations.,0
7,i can and do take religious writings as a metaphor for life. i do this with all sorts of fiction from beowolf to deep space nine. the idea is to not limit yourself to one book screen out the good stuff from what you read and to remember that it is all just a story. you sound buddist to me,0
8,gregg you haven't provided even a title of an article to support your contention. you also have no reason to believe it is an antiislamic slander job apart from your own prejudices. why yes. what's a mere report in the times stating that bcci followed islamic banking rules gregg knows islam is good and he knows bcci were bad therefore bcci cannot have been islamic. anyone who says otherwise is obviously spreading slanderous propaganda. i see. if someone wants to provide references to articles you agree with you will also respond with references to articles you agree with mmm yes that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate. doubtless that's how you spend your time in soc.culture.islam. i've got a special place for you in my... ...kill file. right next to bobby. want to join him the more you post the more i become convinced that it is simply a waste of time to try and reason with moslems. is that what you are hoping to achieve,0
9,imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered. gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators. and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing. now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warmup for censorship and restriction of religious freedom. ever read animal farm well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational. which is it the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism andor strong atheism then your statement is not in general true. the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it. i can't agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have. i don't understand this. can you formalise your argument,0
10,...stuff deleted... thank you. i thought i was in the twilight zone for a moment. it still amazes me that many people with science backgrounds still confuse the models and observables with what even they would call the real world. jim halat,0
11,i suppose for the same reason that you do not believe in all the gods. why should any be any different i use the same arguments to dismiss koresh as i do god. tell me then why do you not believe that koresh is the son of god by logic it is equally possible that koresh is jesus reborn.,0
12,what do you accept as a fact the roundness of the earth after all the ancient greeks thought it was a sphere and then newton said it was a spheroid and now people say it's a geoid yourself isn't your personal identity just a theoretical construct to make sense of memories feelings perceptions i'm trying to think of anything that would be a fact for you. give some examples and let's see how factual they are by your criteria btw what are your criteria. gravity is not a fact is that a fact how about newton's and einstein's thoughts about gravity is it a fact that they had those thoughts i don't see how any of the things that you are asserting are any more factual than things like gravity atoms or evolution. in short before i am willing to consider your concept of what a fact is i'm going to have to have as a minimum some examples of what you think are facts.,0
13,you don't need any counterfeit athiest's myth to make religion appear absurd. you need only read any of friendly christian bill conner's posts.,0
14,exactly. although this may be a dissapointing answer there has to be an interplay of the two. personal ethos and societal morality. a person's selfgeneratedlearned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely mentalverbal level and don't usually find expression in society except in an impure not in the sense of bad state. sometimes this has to be so. also what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society in a very real sense to use the obvious example there is a political society and a racial society and a gender society and sometimes they do not always agree on every issue... yes. perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt others the problem with this is that it is merely saying what you can do it is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred behaviours. i'll add a hearty me two. however one could just as well say just because certain actions are moral does not make them legal one still doesn't really get an impression of which one is truly right. best regards,0
15,yes atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership. are you saying that theists claim to not have self control i don't think atheists are dominantly arrogant. they don't claim some god that has supremacy over all of mankind. now this claim would be arrogant but atheists don't claim it. most atheists do claim to own themselves. i think any disagreement with this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant.,0
16,br from wpratlanta.dg.com bill rawlins br newsgroups alt.atheism br organization dgsid atlanta ga br the problem is that most scientists exclude the br possibility of the supernatural in the question of br origins. is this is a fair premise i utterly br reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of br truth. it is better than the crap that the creationists put out. so far all they have been able to manage is distortions and halftruths. when they are not taking quotes out of context... br some of these socalled humanlike creatures were br apes. some were humans. some were fancifully br reconstructed from fragments. the genetic code has shown more about how man is realted to primates that the fossil record. a little detail the creationists try and ignore. br good deeds do not justify a person in god's br sight. an atonement jesus is needed to atone br for sin. who says your bibletm i would be surprised if any christian followed all of the rules in the bible. most of them just pick and choose according to the local biases. br my point god is the creator. look's like we agree. where is your proof how do you know it was your god br i'll send you some info via email. br regards bill. why not post them i would be interested in seeing them myself.,0
17,prove it. i have a source that says that to date the civilian death count er excuse me i mean collateral damage is about . i have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure. please post the source so its reliability can be judged. this figure would not simply be deaths by bombing but also death later from disease the sewer system of baghdad was deliberately targeted and starvation. i believe but when i get a copy of the latest research in june or july that this was the figure proposed in the census bureau report on the matter. the report was suppressed and the cb attempted to sack the author of the report but failed due to procedural technicality. the author is now on permanent leave.,0
18,not true. only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon. in the particle's own reference frame it takes a very finite time to reach the horizon and the singularity. the math does indeed predict this. take a look at mitchner thorne and wheeler's gravitation. peter walker,0
19,kent sandvik and jon livesey made essentially the same response so this time kent's article gets the reply this begs the question of whether it ever started perhaps because accuracy was always an intention. it makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away reporters if you will. as i said earlier the telephone metaphor is innately bad because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts. also i would point out that by the standards generally asserted in this group the distinction between eyewitnesses and others is hollow since nobody can be shown to be an eyewitness or indeed even shown to be the author of the text. there is no evidence that the original texts of either the ot or the nt are largely lost over time in a sea of errors corrections additions and deletions. in the case of the nt the evidence is strongly in the other direction the textus r. and the nestlealand text do not differ on more than a low level of significance. it is reasonable to assume a similar situation for the ot based on the nt as a model.,0
20,date sun apr gmt from fred rice dariceyoyo.cc.monash.edu.au the qur'an talks about those who take their lusts and worldly desires for their god. i think this probably encompasses most atheists. fred rice dariceyoyo.cc.monash.edu.au as well as all the muslim men screwing fourteen year old prostitutes in thailand. got a better quote,0
21,isaac asimov read creationist books. he read the bible. he had ample opportunity to kneel before his creator and savior. he refused. in fact he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the american humanist association shortly before he died. excerpt from ken ham asimov meets his creator back to genesis no. june p. c included in acts facts vol. no. june from the institute for creation research. this is one of the most offensive articles they've ever publishedbut at least it argues against a deathbed conversion. there's a part of the article even worse than what i've just quoted in which an excerpt from a reader's letter says that if asimov is burning in hell now then he certainly has had a degree change in his former beliefs about creation and the creator. a postdeathbed conversion.,0
22,i think you're letting atheist mythology great start. i realize immediately that you are not interested in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me. i would much prefer an answer from ms healy who seems to have a reasonable and reasoned approach to things. say aren't you the creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about evolution some time ago duh gee then we must be talking christian mythology now. i was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable logical person but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition of the same boring mythology i've seen a thousand times before. i am deleting the rest of your remarks unless i spot something that approaches an answer because they are merely a repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought at all. i have to congratulate you though bill. you wouldn't know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls. such a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated attempts to assist you in learning which i have seen in this forum and others in the past speaks of a talent that goes well beyond my own meager abilities. i just don't seem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences. dean kaflowitz dean reread your comments do you think that merely characterizing an argument is the same as refuting it do you think that ad hominum attacks are sufficient to make any point other than you disapproval of me do you have any contribution to make at all,0
23,what i mean is what i said. what i want does not automatically translate into what i think is right. that is it does not translate that way for me. if you reply that i think it is ok to kill you because that is what i decided then what that means is that for you what i want does translate into what i think is right. it just doesn't translate that way for me.,0
24,you asked me to look over here but i was on my way back anyway reply to cobbalexia.lis.uiuc.edu mike cobb if morals come from what is societally accepted why follow that what right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality pardon the extremism but couldn't i murder your brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them was doing what felt good didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me or i don't follow your morality i believe that morality is subjective. each person is entitled to his own moral attitudes. mine are not a priori more correct than someone elses. this does not mean however that i must judge another on the basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to believe what his own moral sense tells him the rest of society is entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is offensive to the majority. why your last statement. why by which authority most criminals do not see their behavior as moral. the may realize that it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral system but being immoral. for someone to lay claim to an alternative moral system he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be internally consistent. why your last statement. why are these things necessary and believe me a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly consistent. some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and thus may be incapable of behaving morally. while someone like hitler may have believed that his actions were moral we may judge him immoral by our standards. holding that morality is subjective does not mean that we must excuse the murderer. trouble is this would sound just fine coming from someone like hitler too. i do not mean any comparison or offence david. try substituting the social minority of your choice for 'sociopath' 'hitler' and 'murderer'. no logical difference. someone like you vs. someone like hitler. zero sum.,0
25,why don't you ask the approx. two million british muslims who break it five times a day and have never ever been prosecuted under it then ask how easy it is to hold a christian church service in saudi arabia.,0
26,atoms are not objective. they aren't even real. what scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical observable properties of our surroundings. all of which is subjective. jim halat this deserves framing. it really does. atoms aren't even real. tell me then those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are atoms now so what are they figments of our imaginations the evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming but i won't bother with most evidence at the moment. you would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are actaully there as perceived this may be interesting. i thought that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of light can illuminate any object of atomic scale. if this image is to have useful resolution wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed if an atom is a probablity cloud lower resolutions would give the appearance of solidity but it seems fairly certain that an atom is not an object is any conventional sense. obviously i am not a physicist but the question does have ramification of a philosophic nature. anyway just a stray thought carry on ...,0
27,here's a suggestion for the logical argument faq. i don't think it's covered though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one i used how about it mathew inconsistency and counterexample this occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes stand a which is inconsistent with b. there are two variations in which b is either a mutuallyagreedon premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same source. the second party fallaciously responds by saying see the source really does say b it's right here this reply does not refute the allegation of inconsistency because it does not show that the source only says b. example of the first type the koran says unbelievers should be treated in these ways. we can both agree these are immoral. the koran clearly says in this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way. example of the second type there are two biblical creation stories. you're wrong since the bible clearly describes the creation as description. on the first day after christmas my truelove served to me... leftover turkey on the second day after christmas my truelove served to me... turkey casserole that she made from leftover turkey. days deleted ... flaming turkey wings ... pizza hut commercial and mtluagic bait,0

30,there's a difference between believing in the existence of an entity and loving that entity. god could show me directly that he exists and i'd still have a free choice about whether to love him or not. so why doesn't he kevin anthoney kaxcs.nott.ac.uk don't believe anything you read in .sig files.,0
31,a world creator god does the moment it creates the world. and to sayi that you can't recall anyone is even below your usual standard of aarguing. my argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions namely god is perfect god is allknowing god sets the rules. the rules don't work for whatever reason. because of its omniscience the god has known it. in advance. deletion it is not a question of grammar it is a question of modelling. has been discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group. when a is contradictorily defined a does not point to an instance in reality. unless there is more information in the definition of a that allows me to find it somehow. however when the contradictory attribute is said to be essential ie has not got that attribute not the a i am looking for i can conclude that a does not exist. that's quite like i predict coins falling predicted happened . heads tails . tails tails . heads tails . heads tails i take . and dismiss the rest because of the unnecessary complexity the other evidence causes.,0
32,by the way news.announce.newusers has an article can't remember which one that recommends reading a newsgroup for month before posting. this makes sense because you get an idea who the players are and what the current discussions are about. am i the only one who followed that advice no i spent a month just reading too mainly because i did not know much about the way atheists think. i even printed out the faqs and discussed it with a friend before i started posting. alt.atheism deals with religious issues more appropriately lack of religious beliefs which are by their very nature very controversial. it makes sense to read what is being discussed and how just to make sure you are not repeating something others have said better. petri,0
33,precisely my position. as a newbie i tried the pointbypoint approach to debate with these types. it wasted both my time and my lifespan. ignoring them is not an option since they don't go away and doing so would leave one with large stretches of complete anonymity in this group. what's left healthy flaming. i'm sure on occassion i've appeared to be little more than a caustic boob to some of the bobby types. but why waste breath arguing with someone whose most rational though process involves his excretory system and i stand by my record of recognizing these people long before most of the rest of the group. so let's see what this timmons character has in store for us... bob beauchaine bobbevice.ico.tek.com they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea.,0
34,no that's the point of evolution not the point of natural morality. unless of course as i have suggested several times already natural morality is just a renaming. but your yes is actually stronger than this. you are agreeing that every time an organism evolves cooperative behaviour you are going to call it a natural morality. bee dance is a naturally developed piece of cooperative behaviour.,0
35,reply to frankds.uucp frank o'dwyer if the good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism. ditto here. an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it. pretty perceptive that prof. flew. please explain how this helps. i don't see your argument. this makes no sense either. flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the subjectivist. furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the people. and also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by others. ditch the strawman already and see my reply to mike cobb's root message in the thread societal basis for morality.,0
36,acoopermac.cc.macalstr.edu turin turambar me department of utter misery said re. dan schaertel's article if i followed the quoting right i think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation rabbi' seriously then jesus had a full grasp of contemporary scripture' mat jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures... mat jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing mat the scriptures nor the power of god. following from this he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies and the nt says as much mat but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled mat that thus it must be mat but all this was done that the scriptures of the mat prophets might be fulfilled. then all the disciples mat forsook him and fled. if the books comprising the referredto scripture' had not been accessible then it probably would be a different matter.,0

39,i think c.s. lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat. however this argument goes both ways. pretend someone telling plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up and their brains their body is actually ahead of their mind even in voluntarly actions. i don't think plato would have been happy with this and neither would paul although paul's ideas were quite different. however if you would read what we discuss in this group and not just preach you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements. the same applies to the theory of natural selection or other sacred cows of christianity on our origins and human nature. i don't believe in spirits devils or immortal souls any more than in gods. ah you said it. you believe what you want to. this is what i had assumed all along. you might be as well planting satan's seeds ever thought of this besides you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly without any guiding light at all at least i haven't noticed it. i don't think this is at all fair play on god's part. your argument sounds like a version of pascal's wager. please read the faq this fallacy is discussed there. and i failed to get help from the hs because i had a wrong attitude sorry dan but i do not think this spirit exists. people who claim to have access to it just look badly deluded not gifted. petri,0

42,when they're not important yes. all scientists do. otherwise science would never get anywhere. hang about not atomic interactions in general. just specific ones which are deemed unimportant. like gravitational interactions between ions which are so small they're drowned out by electrostatic effects and so on. oh probably. they still make people memorize equations and ir spectra. maybe in a few decades they'll discover the revolutionary data book technique.,0
43,short reply to kent sandvik's post remarking how it is strange that somehow sufism is related to islam as to him they seem quite different. if one really understands islam it is not strange that sufism is associated with it. in fact sufism is in general seen as the inner dimension of islam. one of the roots of the word islam is submission islam denotes submission to god. sufism is the most complete submission to god imaginable in annihilating oneself in god. i am not a sufi or on the sufi path but have read a lot and recently have been discussing a number of things with others who are on the sufi path.,0
44,but theology is full of reason even if it is as we believe based on false premises etc etc. hold on there no meaning to consciousness or mind or self what illogicality since when is for instance nonbehaviourist psychology a pipe dream surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the workings of the mind. manifestations of the mundane sounds rather transcendental to me. in fact matter energy space and time are well measured but mysterious concepts. does an atheist really have to believe in your reductionism or be cast out as not following the true faith,0
45,i read an article about a poll done of students at the ivy league schools in which it was reported that a third of the students indentified themselves as atheists. this is a lot higher than among the general population. i wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are is it because they are more intelligent younger is this the wave of the future,0

47,actually i find the stuff about jc being a carpenter more interesting. is there an independent source for this assertion or is it all from the christian bible is there any record at all of anything he built a table a house some stairs norm abrams says the real test of a carpenter's skill is building stairs with hand tools. did he leave any plans behind for say kitchen counters and cabinets did he build his own cross if so did he use pressuretreated lumber gotta use that pressuretreated anywhere that wood meets concrete but it holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications. i keep seeing these bumperstickers that say my boss is a jewish carpenter but they're always on the back of ford escorts and a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive a pickup so i'm out for verification that he really was a carpenter. dean kaflowitz,0
48,i and many others on a.a have described how we have tried to find god. are you saying our efforts have not been sincere for all the effort i have put in there has been no outward nor inward change that i can perceive. what's a sincerely searching agnostic or atheist supposed to do when even the search turns up nothing how do you accept that which you don't know do you mean that i must believe in your god in order to believe in your god,0
49,sorry fred but for the purposes under discussion here i must disagree. your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet empires since those did not represent true communism. in judging the practical consequences of islam as a force to contend with in the world today it is precisely the khomeini's of the world the rushdiefatwa supporters and perhaps more importantly the reaction of the world muslim community to those extremists that we must look to. perhaps unfortunately from your perspective most people are not concerned with whether islam is the right religion for them or whether the qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia but how islam affects the world around them or what their lives might be like if islam gains in influence. when i consider such possibilities it is with not inconsiderable fear.,0

52,okay i see smilies so this isn't supposed to be a serious post. on the other hand i would suppose it does has some motivation behind it. apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion but there is presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. as an argument this statement is worthless. presuming the qur'an is a perfect religious text whatever that might be there is still plenty of room for disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials. i've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made between two people who in fact do disagree about islam which doesn't presume anything about the qur'an other than its having sufficient clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of islam. this hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have disagreements about all issues relevant to islam.,0

54,as i understand that number is deceptive. the reason is that the money cost was in nonoil sales for the most part. iraq still is not allowed to sell oil or do many of the things under the initial sanctions but is still surviving. of the i have heard figures closer to but i won't quibble your figures most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by enemy troops. a b drops a lot of bombs in one sortie and we used them around the clock. not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions. . the patriot uses a proximity fuse. the adjusted figures for number of patriot kills of ss derivitives is . that figure came not from some fluke in the pentagon but a someone working with such stuff in another part of dod. . the statement precision bombing was the norm is true around areas where civilians were close to the target. we dropped by tonnage very little bombs in populated regions explaining the figures. this figure is far below all the other figures i have seen. if it is indeed accurate then how do you explain the discrepancy between that figure and other figures from international organizations most figures i have seen place the hit ratio close to which is still far higher than your . or does your figure say a bomb missed if the plane took off with it and the bomb never hit the target regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped such methods are used all the time to lie with statistics. i have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure. please post the source so its reliability can be judged.,0
55,...deletions... an islamic bank is something which operates in a different fashion to your modern bank as i have explained here on another thread before. for example islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits but a return on investments which varies according to the market and is not fixed like interest is. islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the islamic world. there are no islamic banks in the west including the usa to my knowledge. i doubt if the market for them exists there at least not while islamic banks are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now. bcci is most certainly not an islamic bank did bcci ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits if the answer to this question is yes then bcci was not an islamic bank as islamic banks are specifically set up to not pay or charge interest. whether some muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely irrelevant.,0
56,riddle me this. if a gods exist why on earth should we grovel why on earth should we give a damm at all what evidence do you have that if such a creatures exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer hatred for what itthey have done in the past whichever gods you care to pick. that is assuming any records of their actions are correct. religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate from the physical world. any belief system can leave you in such a state and so can drugs. gods are not a requirement. only if you remove such useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon. it is that or keep on exterminating those who don't believe or converting them. eric new viruses,0

58,cute characterization bill however there is no inconsistency between the two statements. even if one believes that religion is primitive simpleminded and unscientific antiintellectual and childish one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation. the ideas themselves don't have to be complex before being excised by occam's razor they only have to add unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description. i think the nonessential part of an explanatory system is one that adds no predictive capability to the system. huh watch it your freudian slip is showing,0
59,same old bullshit. not being given to delusions and wishful thinking i do not have the option of either loving or obeying that which i have so reason to believe. more bullshit. i assure you in my misguided youth i made a sincere effort. it was very painful being a rational person raised in christian home. many others could tell the same story. you choose not to believe anyone's experience which contradicts your smug theories.,0
60,what atheists are you talking about imnsho abortion is the womans choice. homosexual sex is the choice of the people involved. war is sometimes necessary. this leaves capital punishment. i oppose capital punishemnt because mistakes can happen yes this thread went around with no resolution recently. as far as poplulation control i think contraception and education are the best courses of action. that's because you are again making the assumption that all atheists have some specific mindset. mistakes can happen bill and i could be the victim of such a mistake.,0
61,actually i just think he's confused. i'm going to hell because i'm gay not becuase i don't believe in god. i wonder if that means i can't come to tammy deans picnic,0
62,...stuff deleted... as many posters have said in as many posts lately this is just not true. for to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all. you make the presumption that the knowledge of the possibility of something is enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest. it is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to think about. it's not either or. sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind. i agree that faith and dogma are inevitable but not necessarily applied to god and religion. it takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning but there is overwhelming reason every single day day in and day out for everyone to put his faith and dogma there. not so with the christian religion.,0

66,anton lavey's interpretation of satanism has always puzzled me. i read his satanic bible a few years ago for a social studies project as well as a book by arthur lyons called the cult of devil worship in america. the latter included a very interesting interview with the black pope in which he did indeed say that satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self. when i refer to satanism i am referring to the mishmash of rural satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the church of satan. i don't consider lavey's church to be at all orthodox nor do i consider its followers satanists. lavey combined the philosophies of nietzsche crowley and reich slapped in some religious doctrine added a little touch of p.t. barnum and christened his creation the church of satan. no doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...i suppose he could have just as easily called it the church of free sex. at any rate it worked for a while. in its heyday the church had a huge following including such hollywood celebrities as sammy davis jr. and jayne mansfield. i have a picture of lavey with sammy by the way. i find the idea of a satanist not believing in satan about as credible as a christian not believing in christ. but if you include the church of satan then i suppose i need to alter my definition. webster's dictionary and the american heritage dictionary will have to do the same.,0
67,deletion well yes but that belongs in the other group there is a interpretation found for everything. however allowing any form of interpretation reduces the information of the text so interprteted to zero. by the way i have checked the quote and i think the lines preceding those quoted above are more interesting where mountains are set on earth in order to immobilize the earth. where the skies heavens are referred to as well supported. the lines given above are after my edition.,0
68,i would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus. in the real world tm it's easier for theists well people in general really to lock themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those people who are of the same opinion as they are. in college you are constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have different ideas about life the universe and everything. it is much much harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from reaching you. so in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in their beliefs over four years. there is nowhere to run....,0
69,well i agree with you in the sense that they have no moral right to inflict these rules but there is one thing i might add at the very least almost everybody wants to avoid pain and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a herd morality then so be it. right and since they grew up and learned around us they have some idea of our right and wrong which i think must in part be incorporated. very rarely do you see criminal behaviour for philosophical reasons stuff deleted best regards adam,0

74,deleted stuff from andrew wrt which atheist myth is bill re to counterfeit atheists. hmmmm. so we're just cheap knockoffs of the true atheists. religion demonstrates itself to be absurd. constantly. personally if someone asks i'm happy to point out how this is so. man what is your pill wrt atheists if you're going to make such contentious statements back them up at least read news timeandtime again we've hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold. try debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like ...more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist. then take a look at the responses we've given tammy. seem pretty reasonable nay even polite to me. accusations of myths aflyin' i saw your reference to according to in the original article. then you do such an excellent job of spewing dogma that well the implication was pretty clear if wrong in this case. jeez a misunderstanding. let it go. more statements to wrap this thing up if you had written your post with the same as care as the faq has been we wouldn't be having this discussion. gems about evidence deleted jeez do i have to point this out to you this discussion is not all instances of human reason. therefore your implication is false. how lame can you get. who said anything about the 'truth' of things read the faq very carefully please. then report your findings about where it says the purpose of a.a is to find the 'truth' of things. and stop impressing your own misguided image of atheists upon us. it's really pissing me off.,0
75,oh no not again. there is a difference between believing that god exists and loving him. for instance satan certainly believes god exists but does not love him. what unbelievers request in situations like this is that god provide evidence compelling enough to believe he exists not to compel them to love him. on the first day after christmas my truelove served to me... leftover turkey on the second day after christmas my truelove served to me... turkey casserole that she made from leftover turkey. days deleted ... flaming turkey wings ... pizza hut commercial and mtluagic bait,0

77,no wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim. it is good to remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination. it is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer. not unlike the rest of your arguments. i am extremely wary of the way you use words. like in this case there are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by themselves and others theists. i have pointed to that in my post. you use one of them. your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption because my moral is objectiveabsolute or the other buzz words you are so fond of everybody will know it and there is no need to define it more exactly. and as a user has shown recently the easiest way to dispell you is to ask you for definitions.,0
78,not by any standard of history i've seen. care to back this up sans the lies apologists are so fond of not really. most of the prophesies aren't even prophesies. they're prayers and comments taken from the torah quite out of context. seems xians started lying right from the beginning. my we're an arrogant ass aren't we you're wrong to think we haven't. the trust was in something that doesn't exist. i'm still willing to die for what i believe and don't believe. so were the loonies in waco. so what besides the point's not to die for what one believes in. the point's to make that other sorry sonofabitch to die for what he believes in doesn't anyone else here get tired of these cretins' tirades peter the damed and damned proud of it,0

82,i would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination grasp at straws or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity. at the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority i remind readers of what i posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist dr. albert sabin. in an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. he admitted to having cried out to god while critically ill and on a respirator. as it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. after his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. don't say it couldn't happen to you or that it hasn't happened to others even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. people are different. i admire dr. sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. i would not think less of asimov for similar weakness. nevertheless i agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue. in any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.,0

86,i heard about the arms sale to saudi arabia. now how is it such a grave mistake to sell saudi arabia weapons or are you claiming that we shouldn't sell any weapons to other countries straightforward answer please. saudi arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering in the politcs of newly renunified yemen including assasinations and border incursions. it is entirely possible that they will soon invade. unluckily for yemen it is not popular in the west as they managed to put aside political differences during reunification and thus the west has effectively lost one half north as a client state.,0
87,very true length of time for discussions on creationism vs evolutionism. atheists and christians have been debating since and still debate with unabated passion . mike i've seen referrences to creation vs evolution several times in a.a and i have question. is either point of view derived from direct observation can either be scientific i wonder if the whole controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the truth rather than the truth itself. both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome and i can't help wondering which came first. as i've pointed out elsewhere my view of human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing anyhthing objectively all knowledge is inherently subjective. so in the context of a.a would you take a stand based on what you actually know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell the difference,0

90,prove it. i am an atheist. it doesn't mean i am for or against abortion. an obvious effect of homosexuality is nonprocreation. that unlike your statement is a fact. please prove that a homosexuality is defended as means of population control b being atheist causes you to hold these beliefs. i defend homosexuality because a what people do with their bodies is none of my business b i defend the equal rights of all humans. do you define values. prove your statement. prove your statement. electrons are waves. electrons are particles. i believe in both. i have physical proof of both. i have no proof of godtm only an ancient book. that is not indicative of the existence of a being with omnipotence or omnipresence. and by your own argument christians don't exist. first of all your earlier statements have absolutely nothing to do with your question. why did you post them to show that athiests besides not existing your view are more humane than christiansother religions secondly i am very much for the control of population growth. the logic that you cannot grasp indicates ignorance of contraception. but of course this is 'outlawed' sometimes literally by religion since if it can't create more followers it will die. i,0

92,i don't think i've changed my stance at all. my original stance was that a painless execution was not a cruel one. i didn't say what would be considered cruel only that a painless death wasn't. now cruelty must involve some sort of suffering i believe. i don't think someone that gets shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much. even a hanging probably produces one sharp instance of pain but it's over so quickly... pardon no. well again i stated that a painless death isn't cruel but i don't think i stated that all painful executions are cruel. i think that some are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain. anything more than an instant i guess. any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel i think this includes the gas chamber and drawing and quartering. i'd say that any pain that lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may be an arbitrary cutoff i suppose.,0

99,absolutely not true. without religion either an established one or one you invent for yourself the theist and atheist are equally not interested in god because without religious revelation there is no information about god available. strip away the dogma and the theistsatheists are no different simply holding a different opinion on a matter of little practical importance. sorry but that doesn't help. what test will you apply to decide whether it is god or satan with whom you are speaking how will you know that you have not simply gone insane or having delusions you are like a loaded gun. ah you not as stupid as i assumed. yes. we're all in this together each human making up a small part of the definition of humanity.,0

102,obviously we have different sources. bill moyers who happens to be a theist to tie this to alt.atheism in his pbs documentary after the war is my main source. i think i still have it on videotape. others include the nation and the progressive. the rest of the article is mere rationalisation. you may claim that sanitation plants are strategic legitimate targets but what happens to the civilians in a city with no sewer system what happens to the civilians when you destroy water purification plants and when hospitals can't handle the resultant epidemics because there is no more electricity and what exactly are your sources we have all i'm sure seen postol's interviews in the media where he demostrates how the pentagon lied about the patriot's effectiveness what is your source for the effectiveness you claim in any case i don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. how about if we move it somewhere else s,0
103,i disagree. in the end the individual is responsible for hisher own irrationality. the individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a symptom of that irrationality. atheists and agnostics i would imagine but yes that was my point. an atheist would theoretically be just as illequipped to study the philosophy of religion as a christian and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers. therefore the conflict between one's religious beliefs or lack thereof and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert. the fact that most philosophers may be nonreligious was a secondary point. as opposed to science practiced by theists be careful here. science does have a builtin defence against faith and dogma skepticism. unfortunately it is not foolproof. there is that wonderful little creature known as the theory. many of us believe in the theory of evolution. we have no absolute proof that this theory is true so why do we believe it because it makes more sense than... there is quite a bit of faith involved here. well not all current beliefs are deficient but basically i agree. ideally this is true. in reality though you have to acknowledge that scientists are human. scientists have egos and biases. some scientists assume a particular theory is true refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof for the theory. remember cold fusion not really. i agree that we spent far too much money on the waco crisis i believe especially considering the outcome. my point was that mass suicides in the u.s. are rare jonestown was in guyana incidentally although we footed the bill for the cleanup and the u.s. has far more important issues to address. compare the number of u.s. citizens who have died in mass suicides with say the number of u.s. soldiers who died during one week of the vietnam war and you will see my point.,0

107,this is the most unmitigated bilge i've seen in a while. jim brown obviously has possession of the rightwing token. in december former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski told a senate committee that sanctions were costing iraq million per day and that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world. iraq he suggested was losing badly every day it defied the un demands while the community of nations won every day with no taking of life or loss of life. fcnl washington newsletter. wrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the us government perhaps regrettable of course thewayitis certainly not. good heavens an escapee from rush limbot land conservative my ass. bullshit in the gulf massacre of all ordnance used was smart. the rest that's was just regular dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. have you forgotten that the pentagon definition of a successful patriot launch was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage or that a successful interception of a scud was defined as the patriot and scud passed each other in the same area of the sky and of the that was the smart stuff hit. again try to follow me here that means of this smart arsenal missed. prove it. i have a source that says that to date the civilian death count er excuse me i mean collateral damage is about . s no one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in washington state but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than incarceration. california is spending more than million annually on capital cases and until this year hadn't executed anyone since . texas the national leader in the number of executions spends an estimated . million per execution. that compares to an average cost of incarceration in washington state of per maximumsecurity prisoner per year.,0
108,first i don't expect them to love me if they don't even know i exist. secondly i wouldn't expect them to love me simply because they were my creator. i would expect to have to earn that love. are you daft how do i love something i don't believe exists come back when you've learned to love your third testicle. at which point you have stepped over the line and become a complete asshole. even though it's your first offense i won't let it slip becuase i've heard it too goddamned many times. you love jesus because deep in your heart you're a cannibalistic necrophiliac. because i say so and i'm much more qualified to assess your motivations than you are. fortunately there are some things i get to accept on evidence rather than faith. one of them being that until christians like yourself quit being so fucking arrogant there will never be peace. you've all made sure of that. bob beauchaine bobbevice.ico.tek.com they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea.,0

110,in a word yes.,0
111,sadly understandable... yes. to be fair you should really qualify this as semiticwestern religions but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway. again this should really be evaluated at a personal level. for example there was only one jesus presumably and he probably didn't say all that many things and yet seemingly billions and billions of christian sects have arisen. perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in christ as in pantheism. it would seem to go against the bible but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation. this is a good point. we have here the quintessential christian he sets up a system of valuesbeliefs for himself which work very well and every eventexperience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system. however we also have an individual who has the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all the tests fail. in other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the biasresponsibility of losingretaining a system. interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances although not always i will admit and probably it is the massoriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant unfortunately. granted in which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if i may be so bold as to extend your similie also understandable... best regards,0

117,... my stuff deleted ... bill you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism. it doesn't. this board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy to share posters' experiences regarding atheism to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole to share resources relating to atheism and even to socialize with others with similar views. and of course with the number of theists who come here to preach it is also used to argue the case for atheism. if you want to accuse people of lying please do so directly. the phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic. the two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are christianity and islam. both of these claim to make their followers into good people and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths. imho they are right. the american friends service committee quaker catholic relief services bread for the world salvation army soup kitchens and mother theresa spring to mind. can someone with more knowledge of islam supply the names of some analagous islamic groups when mother theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her christianity i believe her. her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need. the point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals if it is widespread enough it can change societies. the same works for the horrors of history. to claim that christianity had little to do with the crusades or the inquisition is to deny the awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute. what it seems you are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion has had no evil impacts on history. that is absurd.,0

127,another one rescued from the bit bucket... over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and elsewhere on the net. generally the discussion comes down to the contention on the one hand that tsv contains such blood libel against islam as to merit if not death than at least banning and probably some sort of punishment and on the other that rushdie particularly as a nonmuslim in a western country had every right to write and publish whatever he chose regardless of whether some muslims find it offensive without fear of persecution or death. i am naturally inclined to the latter position but find myself in an interesting position because i think this is a fine book only incidentally concerned with islam and moreover i'm damned if i can find anything malevolently offensive in it. over the years when i have made this point various primarily muslim posters have responded saying that yes indeed they have read the book and had called it such things as filth and lies i would rank rushdie's book with hitler's mein kempf or worse and so on. unfortunately these comments are usually generalities and attempts to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so offensive have met either with stony silence more generalizations or inaccurate or outofcontext references to the book which lead me to believe that few of them have actually read it. corrections and attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored. anyway since i seem to be the only one following this particular line of discussion i wonder how many of the rest of the readership have read this book what are your thoughts on it jim perry perrydsinc.com decision support inc. matthews nc these are my opinions. for a nominal fee they can be yours.,0

132,. . . i am a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable. the concepts of right and wrong or correctincorrect or truefalse belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions. it makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong although it is legitimate to ask if it is good or better than another position. let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics perception and motivation respectively. one can certainly ask if a percept is right correct true veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory. but it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false. on the other hand it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil but one can certainly ask that question about motives. therefore your suggested answers ac simply can't be considered they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment. now the problem with d is that it is doublebarrelled i agree with the first part that the rightness of a moral position is a meaningless question for the reasons stated above. but that is irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that one cannot feel peace is better than war. i certainly can make value judgments bad better best without asserting the correctness of the position. sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ad. my short e answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue neither is right correct or wrong incorrect. they simply hold different moral values feelings.,0
133,as per various threads on science and creationism i've started dabbling into a book called christianity and the nature of science by jp moreland. a question that i had come from one of his comments. he stated that god is not necessarily a religious term but could be used as other scientific terms that give explanation for events or theories without being a proven scientific fact. i think i got his point i can quote the section if i'm being vague. the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates. are there explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of themselves or can everything be quantified measured tested etc. mac michael a. cobb ...and i won't raise taxes on the middle university of illinois class to pay for my programs. champaignurbana bill clinton rd debate cobbalexia.lis.uiuc.edu,0
134,the willingness of true believers to die for their belief be it in jesus or jim jones is welldocumented so martyrdom in and of itself says little. it does say something about the depth of their belief. religion has both deluded believers and con men. the difference is often how far they will follow their beliefs. i have no first hand or even second hand knowledge of how the original apostles died. if they began a myth in hopes of exploiting it for profit and followed that myth to the death that would be inconsistent. real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would lead to discomfort pain and death.,0

136,bill i think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. lack of belief in god does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values. i hope you would accept the fact that for instance buddhists appreciate issues related to nonempirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism. i think reading a couple of books related to buddhism might revise and fine tune your understanding of nonchristian systems. cheers kent,0
137,i saw a hour show on pbs the other day about the history of the jews. appearently the cursadesa religious war agianst the muslilams in 'the holy land' sparked the widespread persecution of muslilams and jews in europe. among the supporters of the persiecution were none other than martin luther and the vatican. later hitler would use luthers writings to justify his own treatment of the jews.,0
138,could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or tradition is viewed in a metaphorical way of course this is essentially what we do with homer or with other concepts such as fate luck free will ... however there remains the question of whether the religious literature of say christianity is a particularly good set of metaphors for the world today. it's also entirely unclear and to me quite unlikely that one could take a contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential from the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases.,0

143,some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in what does it take some kind of faith to say that the great invisible pink unicorn does not exist does it take some kind of faith to say that santa claus does not exist if it does and it may for some people i suppose it certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things and god do exist. i suppose it depends on your notion and definition of faith. besides... not believing in a god means one doesn't have to deal with all of the extra baggage that comes with it this leaves a person feeling wonderfully free especially after beaten over the head with it for years i agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer for many people and for that reason i think it's important. however trying to force a psychological fantasy i don't mean that in a bad way but that's what it really is on someone else who isn't interested is extremely rude. what if i still believed in santa claus and said that my belief in santa did wonderful things for my life making me a better person allowing me to live without guilt etc... and then tried to get you to believe in santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me you'd call the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone.,0
144,for example i would claim that the recent assassination of four catholic construction workers who had no connection with the ira was probably religously motivated. what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n.i are not religously motivated given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland into a country that has a particular church written into its constitution and which has restriction on civil rights dictated by that church i fail to see why the word past is appropriate. you don't have to hand us a bunch of doubletalk about what i was seemingly attacking. i quoted what i was attacking.,0

158,i have never said that only humans are the only beings which are sufficiently sentient to have intentions. in fact i have explicitly said that i am perfectly happy to consider that some animals are capable of forming intentions. what i am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive behaviour to have moral significance since it seems to me such behaviour does not involve intention. that's not the point. the point is whether the implementor thinks at all. the issue is not whether thinking produces opinion a or opinion b but whether thinking takes place period. since humans are part of nature are not all human actions natural. or perhaps you're going to throw in a definition of natural that will allow us to describe some actions as natural and some as not natural. if so what is the definition sure they do as multiple posters have show you. sharks for example eat wounded sharks. i've personally seen cats eat their newborn. are you in some kind of denial people give you example after example and you go off the air for a week and then pop up claiming that it never happened. it's very strange. see what i mean. here we go again. what do we have to do write up a tailormade faq just for mr schneider,0
159,in article cmw.qrdarkside.osrhe.uoknor.edu bilokcforum.osrhe.edu i'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer. science is a human activity and as such is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity. the myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist is nonsense. bill this is wonderfully phrased. i assume you understand that your statement is also undermining such human constructs as religion as well. kent i'll accept this as a compliment although i'm always a little paranoid when visiting a.a thanks. yes i do know the extent of the statements relevence it's what i think of as human nature. i'm not sure it undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special knowledge about the truth and since such claims are always suspect all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species. my point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human claims. the trick here then is to find some way to abstract our infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we can see what there is to see. i can think of no way this can be done.,0

162,ultimately it rests with personal opinion...in my opinion. the question doesn't make sense to me. maybe it would be better to ask what makes a democracy better than for example a totalitarian regim,0
163,and in that area what you care about is whether someone is sceptical critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and easily led on the other. indeed i may. and one may be an atheist and also be gullible excitable and easily led. i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led. whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point. sure. but whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing not whether they are easily led. not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible excitable and easily led from some concrete cause. in that case we would also have to discuss if that concrete cause rather than atheism was the factor that caused their subsequent behaviour. i'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour merely that it is not relevant to the definition of atheism which is 'lack of belief in gods'.,0

165,from a parallel thread. much about definitions of bombs etc. deleted. ... mathew i agree. this it seems is the crux of your whole position isn't it that the us shouldn't have supported hussein and sold him arms to fight iran i agree. and i agree in ruthlessly hunting down those who did or do. but we did sell arms to hussein and it's a done deal. now he invades kuwait. so do we just sit back and say well we sold him all those arms i suppose he just wants to use them now. too bad for kuwait. no unfortunately sitting back and letting things be is not the way to correct a former mistake. destroying hussein's military potential as we did was the right move. but i agree with your statement reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to sell arms to hussein. so it's really not the gulf war you abhor so much it was the u.s.'s and the west's shortsightedness in selling arms to hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable right if so then i agree. more deleted. regards,0
166,meng i have a better prayer dear god please save the world from the likes of these,0
167,no its not. its due to the fact that there are two issues here religion and religion. religion is personal belief system. religion is a memetic virus. people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from religion religion. people that want to save others are firmly entrenched in religion memoids. rule of not practicing religion is to shut the fuck up unless you discuss it politely. this means that the motive behind the conversation is not only your selfgratifying wish to spread the word. religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person and reflects their value judgements. religion is something that is contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements other than perhaps i think i'll be brainwashed today. religion is a drug... i believe you can discuss religion. however the post that started this off was not intented as discussion it was more a proclamation of someones religion.,0

169,that's fascinating. i take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the constitution of the people who stole their continent. you could be right but it sounds plausible to me. is there any reason that you dismiss it outofhand here's some more recent scholarship has shown that in the mids indians were not only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding fathers but that the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy arguably became the single most important model for the albany plan of union and later the articles of confederation and the constitution. that this would be absent from our school texts and from history and from media is not surprising given the devotion americans feel to our founding myth great men gathered to express a new vision that has withstood the test of time. if it were revealed that indians had a role in it imagine the blow to the american psyche. ... by when most of these men and others gathered to creat the albany plan of union the first try at confederation they invited fortytwo members of the iroquois grand council to serve as advisors on confederate structures. benjamin franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the iroquois achievement in a famous speech at albany congress it would be a strange thing...if six nations of ignorant savagessic should be capable of forming such a union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted for ages and appears indissoluble and yet that a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen english colonies. according to grinde franklin convened meetings of iroquois chiefs and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he acknowedged to be similar to the iroquois confederacy. grinde is professor donald grindejr. of the university of california at riverside whose book the iroquois and the founding fathers of the american nation addresses this issue.,0

171,i looked back at this and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which i had claimed and you poohpoohed. the us has not sold iraq any arms. their navy is entirely made of fussr vessels. their airforce not including stuff captured from kuwait which i am not as sure about doesn't include any us equipment. their missiles are all nonus. their tanks are almost all soviet with about french tanks older ones. the only us stuff in the iraqi arsenal is a few ms. those were not sold to iraq. iraq captured them from other countries like kuwait. information is hard to prove. you are claiming that the us sold information prove it. now how did the us build up iraq again i just gave some fairly conclusive evidence that the us didn't sell arms to iraq. information is hard to prove almost certainly if the us did sell information then that fact is classified and you can't prove it. if you can provide some useful evidence that the us sold arms or valuable intelligence to iraq i am very interested but not if you just make claims based on what everyone knows.,0

194,as i don't know this book i will use your heresay. it depends on how he defines god. the way i understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. ideas drawn from an understanding that god is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified that is where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them. some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable and especially subserviant in a basic way to religious dogma. this pursuit always fails. reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. it gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers at best. science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions. more questions can be posed than it can answer. at the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction.,0

198,consider special relativity. it hasn't be proved nor has it been disproved. no one has a proof one way or the other but many people are interested in it i've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of god one way or the other. the two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism. of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism but similarly no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism. in naturalism any phenomenon that could be described as god is considered part of the natural world to be studied as any other natural phenomenon gravity for instance. for example if a loud godlike'' voice vociferously announced i am god i exist and i will prove it by reversing the force of gravity'' and if then gravity did indeed reverse a naturalist probably a scientist would say boy we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we thought we did and that loud voice is something new. perhaps we didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.'' i'm sure glad you don't know where i live since you don't seem to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices in your head and god's voice. you seem to have missed my point. even if jim jones and david koresh were not religious people my point remains that faith and dogma are dangerous and religion encourages them. jim jones and david koresh also encouraged them. my point does not rely on jim jones and david koresh being religious.,0

200,i hope there is not one with a subject like this you just have a spiral. what would then be a morality of a morality of morals. labels don't make arguments. one really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be interpreted even though this would hardly seem moral. for example the best thing for me is to ensure that i will eat and drink enough. hence all actions must be weighed against this one statement. whatever helps this goal is moral whatever does not is immoral of course this leads such a blank space there are so many different ways to fulfill a goal one would need a hypermorality to apply to just the methods. seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think about it long enough on the other hand maybe it is our first gut reaction... which who knows perhaps here we have a way to discriminate morals. i don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right the same way i instinctively feel torture is wrong but if i thought about it long enough and listened to the arguments i could perhaps reason that it was wrong is that possible see the difference best regards adam,0

212,i think this should be illuminating to all. let me make a first suggestion. when arabic words especially technical ones become of use let us define them for those especially atheists to whom they may not be terribly familiar. please also note that though i did initially refer to khomeini as a heretic for what i understood to be a claim rejected by you since of personal infallibility i withdraw this as a basis for such a statement. i conditionally retain this reference in regard to khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the socalled twelve imams which is in clear conflict with the qur'an in that it places the twelve imams in a category of behavior and example higher than that of the muhammad in that the qur'an shows that the prophet was clearly fallible as well as it appears given your abstruse theological statment regarding the natures of the twelve imams placing them in a different metaphysical category than the remainder of humanity with the possible exception of muhammad something which verges on the sin of association. alaikum wassalam,0
213,another article that fell between the cracks as evidence for the resurrection it is often claimed that the disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that jesus had come back from the dead. now i skimmed acts and such and i found a reference to this happening to stephen but no others. where does this apparently very widely held belief come from is there any evidence outside the bible is there any evidence in the bible i sure haven't found any... briefly no. there is widespread folklore but no good documentary evidence or even solid rumor concerning the deaths of the apostles. further the usual context of such arguments as you observe is no martyrs for a lie i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief. this adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting. since we don't even know how or where they died we certainly don't have this information. by the way even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting. the willingness of true believers to die for their belief be it in jesus or jim jones is welldocumented so martyrdom in and of itself says little. see kings for a biblical account of the martyrdom of priests of baal.,0

217,deletion the reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. you have used the terms absolute objective and others interchangeably. same with moral values values at all worth measuers and usefulness. you infer from them as if they were the same. to the if. when the if is not fulfilled your intermission is a waste of time. assuming that you don't intend this it is reasonable to conclude that you want to argue a point. you have made a interesting statement here namely that of the disinterested observer. there is no such thing in morals. probably the shortest proof for objective and morality being a contradiction. fine. and that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. i could name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. not that that wasn't mentioned before. in other words you have nothing to fulfill your strong claims with. clutching a straw. i don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were loaded terms are fixpoints. those who deny the morality of freedom make quite clear what they say their practice is telling. yes there are even those who are willingly unfree. it is quite common in religions by the way. for one there is a religion which is named submission. don't even try to argue that submission is freedom. if it were so it would argue my case. but i am afraid that that is considered proof.,0

232,mc theory of creationism my theistic view of the theory of mc creationism there are many others is stated in genesis mc . in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. and which order of creation do you accept the story of creation is one of the many places in the bible where the story contradicts itself. the following is an example... gen and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good. gen and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. gen and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him. gen and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof. even your bible cannot agree on how things were created. why should we believe in it,0

234,liberate is the way an invader describes an invasion including if i'm not mistaken the iraqi liberation of kuwait. never invaded nicaragua only with more word games can you say send in the marines oh good word games. if you let the aggressor pick the words there's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action. that's a convenient technique much seen on alt.atheism define those who disagree with you according to a strawman extreme that matches virtually nobody. very noble and patriotic. i'm sure the fine young americans who carpetbombed iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon destroyed iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the sky or further or who bulldozed other iraqi infantry into their trenches or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to were just thrilled to be risking death if not risking it by much in the defense of the liberty of ... well wealthy kuwaitis. can't have those oilfields under a tyrant's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic to us interests... having pigeonholed peaceniks in this context people who disagree with me about the conduct of the gulf war into peaceatallcosthitlersupportinggenocideabettingwimps you can now express righteous indignation when they refuse to fit this mold and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms. how dare they yes hypocrisy indeed those violent peaceniks care to list an example here wow instant ''s nostalgia of course peacenik itself is a ''s cold war derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism with godless pinko communists. yes indeed i felt my freedoms mightily threatened by iraq...,0

236,peter simple logic arguments are folly. if you read the bible you will see i can't. it seems jesus used logic to make people using logic look like fools no that does not sound right he maybe just told they were fools and that's it and people believed that... hmm does not sound reasonable either... i find it always very intriguing to see people stating that transcendental values can't be explained and then in the next sentence they try to explain these unexplained values. highly strange. cheers kent,0
237,so in conclusion it can be shown that there is essentially no logical argument which clearly differentiates a cult from a religion. i challenge anyone to produce a distinction which is clear and can't be easily knocked down. how about this one a religion is a cult which has stood the test of time. just like history is written by the winners' and not the losers.' from what i've seen of religions a religion is just a cult that was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it's doctrine using political and military measures. perhaps if koresh withstood the onslaught for another couple of months he would have started attracting more converts due to his strength' hence becoming a full religion and not just a cult.,0
238,i've been following this train of talk and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense not real leaves me uneasy. it seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real. the tree outside my window is in this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it not the tree itself. the observation is indirect but no more so than observations i have made of atoms. also what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms. i am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum zeno effect where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time. some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either. one has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field. what i read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring. anyway if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think it worked. after doing so i'm willing to try to defend the following assertion if anyone cares,0
239,i heard about the arms sale to saudi arabia. now how is it such a grave mistake to sell saudi arabia weapons or are you claiming that we shouldn't sell any weapons to other countries straightforward answer please. who benefits from arms sales hint it isn't normally the gov't. it is the contractor that builds that piece of equipment. believe it or not the us and uk don't export the huge quantities of arms that you have just accused them of doing. arms exports are rare enough that it requires an act of congress for nonsmall arms to most countries if not all. do you believe in telling everyone who can do what and who can sell their goods to whom,0
240,the r us is not trademarked but the backwards r us is i believe. speaking of proofs of god the funniest one i have ever seen was in a term paper handed in by a freshman. she wrote god must exist because he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really doesn't is this argument really so much worse than the ontological proofs of the existence of god provided by anselm and descartes among others,0

242,deletion rest deleted that's a fallacy and it is not the first time it is pointed out. for one you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. unlike a football. further you conveniently ignore here that there are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. the analogy does not hold. one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a set of morals you have to give. further the above is evidence not proof. proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.,0

246,sounds like you were going to a different penn state or something. kampus krusade for khrist is very vocal here but they really have little power to get anything done. sometimes it seems like there are a lot of them because they're generally more vocal than their opposition but there really aren't that many krusaders. the liberals tend to keep to themselves if they can help it since all they really want is to be allowed to go about their own lives the way they want to. ...so you don't hear from or about most of them. the biblebangers stand out because they want everyone to be forced to live according to biblebanger rules. the krusaders certainly don't run this place. i'd say we've got a rather average mix. of people here.... much like the rest of the u.s. and just like everywhere else some factions are louder than others.,0

250,perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is. if we can't measure anything objectively then the answers we get from physics aren't objective either. that's what i mean when i say there's no objective physics. sure we can all agree that say f gmmr but that's maths. it's only physics when you relate it to the real world and if we can't do that objectively we're stuck. of course this displays my blatant bias towards applied science but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations based on real world observations. it's an axiom that it's invariant. but if the two of us measure it we'll get different answers. yes we call that experimental error but it's not really error in the conventional sense in fact if you don't get any that's an error you could argue that the value of c is objective to within some value. but i'd call that a rather odd usage of the word objective and it opens the way for statements like murder is objectively wrong for all people to within of the total population.,0

253,well yes. this is the real mystery of the matter and why i am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories. there are a number of places where the masoretic text mt of the ot is obscure and presumably corrupted. these are reproduced exactly from copy to copy. the dss tend to reflect the same errors. this would appear to tell us that at least from some point people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically. the problem is we don't know what they did before that. but it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts. they may be added to and in some situations such as the end of mark material is lost but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text. you're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. some people like to use the game of telephone as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts. this clearly wrong. the texts are transmitted accurately.,0

259,the clipper initiative is an announcement by clinton that all the secure voice phones will use the same crypto chip as a defacto government standard. problem is the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily and the justice department will be using the keys to listen in on illegal activities. many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release. the project was developed by nsa and given to nist. it uses two keys s and s that the government claims are needed to break the code. they claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip they have to get the keys from both companies. people have poked holes through and through the press release official version and shown how it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds and i have given the simplified version. people over on sci.crypt are really scared about this proposal it seems.,0

261,great start. i realize immediately that you are not interested in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me. i would much prefer an answer from ms healy who seems to have a reasonable and reasoned approach to things. say aren't you the creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about evolution some time ago duh gee then we must be talking christian mythology now. i was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable logical person but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition of the same boring mythology i've seen a thousand times before. i am deleting the rest of your remarks unless i spot something that approaches an answer because they are merely a repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought at all. .. i have to congratulate you though bill. you wouldn't know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls. such a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated attempts to assist you in learning which i have seen in this forum and others in the past speaks of a talent that goes well beyond my own meager abilities. i just don't seem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences.,0
262,however to underestimate the power of religion creating historical events is also a big misunderstanding. for instance would the yearold war have ever started if there were no fractions between the protestants and the vatican cheers kent,0
263,society is the collection of individuals which will fall under selfdefined rules. in terms of un decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented at the un are considered part of that society. if we then look at us federal laws provided by representatives of purely us citizens then the society for that case would be the citizens of the us and so on. acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are nonverbally and in effect nonconsciously such as picking your nose on the oprah winfrey show noone does it but there is no explicit law against doing it. in many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a behaviour is acceptable but one can deduce these behaviours by observation. in an increasingly litigation mad society this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid. with the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in american and australian to bring in my local perspective culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. for instance some cultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals. most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. however is it moral according to the multicultural american society this kind of problem may only be definable by legislation. obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is acceptable behaviour or not and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions. one thing is for sure there is no universal moral code which will suit all cultures in all situations. there may however be some globally accepted mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable concept. the majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon this earth are living in a similar environment if that ever happens.,0

267,i've heard that in california they ask you to swear without any mention of a god. what states actually include god in the courtroom oath,0
268,this is a very good point. i have already made the clear claim that khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the qur'an and have given my arguments for this. this is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested. khomeini being dead really can't respond but another poster who supports khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. this should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism. so to answer your question the only way you can judge is by learning more about islam that is by reading the qur'an and understanding it's basic principles. once one has done this it is relatively easy to see who is following the principles of islam and who is acting in a way at odds with islam. khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles of islam which is that no human being is metaphysically different than any other human being and in no sense any closer to god in metaphysical nature.,0

270,first you seem to assume all atheists think alike. an atheist does not believe in the existence of a god. our opinions on issues such as capital punishment and abortion however vary greatly. if you were attacking the views of a particular atheist benedikt i presume then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together. as for the issues let's start with abortion. personally i do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraceptionafterthefact. however i support the right of any woman to have an abortion regardless of what my personal views may be because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what heshe may or may not do to hisher body and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus. that's my opinion and i am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me. i do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control but i certainly defend it as an end to itself. i think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down. as for atheists believing all values are biological i have no idea what you're talking about. finally there are the issues of war and capital punishment. an atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might. you seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and population control. could this be the atheist cause you were referring to a few posts back,0
271,ks this is the story of kent the archetype finn that lives in the ks bay area and tried to purchase thomas paine's age of reason. this ks man was driving around to staceys to books inc to well cleanlighted ks place to daltons to various other places. ks when he asked for this book the well educated american book store ks assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section ks or then they said that his book has not been published yet but they ks should receive the book soon. in some places the assistants bluntly ks said that they don't know of such an author or that he is not ks a well known living author so they don't keep copies of his books. ks such is the life and times of america years after the revolution. sigh now i don't feel so bad. searching for a copy in bookstores has been a habit of mine for at least two years now. i spend a lot of time browsing through bookstores new and and used and i've not once seen a copy. now i know all i do is pick up a phone and order the darned thing but come on this is america and he's one of the founding fathers. and no one carries his books sure you can find common sense but i think that's because it's required reading for most colleges. i did find one holeinthewall bookstore where the owner said that they usually carry one or two copies but that they were currently out. i haven't been back since so i don't know if he was telling the truth or not. sigh...,0

281,there would be some point to doing longterm monitoring of things like particles and fields not to mention atmospheric phenomena. however there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. to be precise there is no particular plan period. this is a large part of the problem. in this context it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time. the closest approach to any sort of longterm planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like galileo or cassini. it is most unlikely that there is much happening on pluto that would be worth monitoring and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for. the combined need to arrive at pluto within a reasonable amount of time and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit is beyond what can reasonably be done with current that is svintage propulsion. most of this can be done just about as well from earth. the few things that can't be can be done better from a voyagerlike spacecraft that is not constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.,1
282,if you're doing largescale satellite servicing being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense. the question is whether anyone is going to be doing largescale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justifying development of such a thing. you'd almost certainly use air. given that you have to pressurize with something safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing to avoid needing a ventilation system it's nice if the hangar atmosphere is breathable in a pinch it makes mask functioning much less critical.,1
283,how about the discussion of the sts tether experiment. ran forward it would suck energy from the earth's magnetic field while trivially slowing the shuttle. it could also have run backward if they ran electricity through the tether the other way it would have trivially propelled the shuttle faster. but an even better example comes to mind. there's this electronics guy someone like craig anderton or don lancaster. ten years ago he wrote about an invention of his. he could take a lightdetector run current through it at about a hundred times its rating and it would glow. he got legal rights to this design of a combination fiber optic emitterreceiver. this turned out to be the basic unit of att's i think plan to bring brazil's communications system into the st century. the article was mostly about his legal wranglings with the company that eventually got him wellcompensated for his invention.,1
284,dandridge cole and isaac asimov collaborated on a book titled habitable planets for man i think in . it should be available in most good libraries or through interlibrary loan. it answered the questions you ask speculatively of course along with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies length of day for daynight temperature variation and agricultural concerns partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses ever hear of xenon narcosis neither did i density of particulates in the atm and their composition ever hear of silicosis not much fun etc. climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you but axial tilt ought to. it plays a large part in determining the severity of seasonal differences and a lesser but still significant part in determining the speed of prevailing winds.,1

287,it's a moot point step out of your door go anywhere except possibly your mailbox. you will be subject to some ad agency's 'poor taste' while i'm sure sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldn't be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. modern groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field the opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased telescopes. in any case a bright point of light passing through the field doesn't ruin observations. if that were the case the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned they are extremely bright.,1
288,my comment was off the top of my head i wasn't aware that it had already been thought of. guess it's true that there's nothing new under the sun or in this case the flying billboards.,1
289,right now the hst sevicing mission is listed as days. before it was listed as days. they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to after simulations indicated that it was not doable in . after all the space walking they are going to reboost the hst's orbit. i think right now it's sitting at miles up they would like . i don't know the exact orbit numbers. i know when hst was first flown it was placed in the highest possible shuttle orbit. now the shuttle can cary a thing called the edo pallet or extended duration orbiter pallet. it's mostly loxlh for the fuel cells and rcs gear plus more o and canisters for the life support rebreathers. maybe more nitrogen too. the limit on spacewalking is a function of suit supplies mass and orbiter duration. in order to perform the reboost of the hst the oms engines will be fired for a long period. now the shuttle is a heavy thing. the hst isn't light either. the amount of oms fuel needed to fly both up is substantial. a small booster carried up and used to boost hst on it's own will weigh significantly less then the oms fuel required to boost both hst and shuttle for a given orbital change. from what i understand the mass margins on the hst missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra suits or mmu's. now if they used a small tug i would bet just a wild guess that the savings on amss margin would allow carrying the edo pallet extra suits more consumables parts for the flaky fgs sensor parts for the balky solar electronics and still enough for a double magnum of champagne. or the hst could even get placed into some sort of medium orbit. the reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing and longer drag life. a whatever it is the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint on hst ops.,1
290,getting wierd again okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to pluto is to large and to expensive.. okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. kind of liek the old mirv principle of old cold war days. basically what i mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for different missionsnamely different planets. each probe would be tied in with the mother ship or earth as the case may be.. this is good when and if we go for mars the mars mission can act as either mother ship or relay point for the probes. also the mother ship would be powered if not the mars mission by a normal propulsion but also a solar sail main reason for solar sail race is to see what can be done and autmoated the sail would get the probes to were they needed.. i know the asteroidmeteor clouds and such might get in the way of a sail main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send multiple probesmissionsatellitesexploreres to different places and cut costs.. the probes could do fly bys or we shall see...,1

297,the single launch core station concept. a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used to launch the station into orbit. shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation. karl dishaw mcimail.com replied why jettison the ssmes why not hold on to them and have a shuttle bring them down to use as spares one performance reason comes to mind if you jettison the ssme's you don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burns. onorbit ssme's are just dead weight since we don't have an ssme ho pressurization mechanism which works in zerog. this means that you can't use them for reboost or anything else. dead weight has a couple of advantages but more disadvantages. throwaway ssme's might let us use some of the old ssme's which are not quitemanratable. but i doubt we'd do that the cost of a launch failure is too high. ken jenks nasajscgm space shuttle program office kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov,1

300,thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my question about which countries engage in space surveillance. unfortunately i apparently didn't make the meaning of the message clear since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance rather than space surveillance what i meant was not which countries use satellites to look at the earth satellite reconnaissance but was which countries have programs to detect and track i.e. determine the orbital elements of satellites as they pass overhead space surveillance. the us uses missiledefense radars supplemented by a fascinating quasiradar operated by the navy to do this for satellites in leo and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above km or so. the fee i understand does much the same thing. amateur satellite observers use eyeballs binoculars stopwatches and pcs for objects out to around km enabling them to keep track of satellites for which ah official element sets aren't available. see the fascinating books by desmond kinghele for details as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov. the material posted in my previous message suggests that japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree and it may be that other countries do also. which was the question i meant to ask who are they how do they do it and why do they do it allen thomson saic mclean va,1

304,in answer to amruth laxman apart from the fact that you get g in the pullout not the dive that figure is about right for sustained g no protection. the duration of g it's rate of onset body position and support aids are all critical parts of the equation. i remember one note about instrumented gridiron players recording peaks about g. stapp the aviation doctor either by accident or design took a shortperiod g in a rocketsled decelleration eyeballsout against a standard 's harness. it had to be short calculate the stopping time even from mph at that g. a bangseat can get up to about g and you'd better be sitting straight. find the book by martinbakers human guinea pig to hear how bad it can get if the rate of onset is too high. a reclining position and a good gsuit can keep a pilot functioning at around g. a flotation tank should be a good bet since you can treat the body as a fluid and highpressure situations are not new. anyone have any figures,1
305,a bright light phenomenon was observed in the eastern finland on april . at . ut two people saw a bright luminous pillarshaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near mikkeli. the head of the pillar was circular. the lower part was a little winding. it was like a monster they told. they were little frightened. soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged. a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon. at last the light landed behind the nearby forest. now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise. the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in lappeenranta. at . ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont. the altitude of the trail was only about degrees. soon the trail began to grow taller. a loop was appeared in the head of the trail. it was like a spoon. this lasted only seconds. now the altitude was about five degress above horizont. he noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop. the spot was at magnitude . the loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop. a cartwheelshaped trail was appeared round the bright spot. after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont. luminous trails were still visible at . ut in the morning sky. the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket. i don't know if there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near arkhangelsk but this may be a rocket experiment too. since we have observed over rocket phenomena in finland. most of these are rocket experiments military missile tests barium experiments and other chemical releases. during these years we have observed satellite launches. leo wikholm,1
306,jeremy are you talking about a single batse component or the whole thing you could propose a batse probe launch two or three with ion drive on various planetary trajectories... your resolution increaces the more they're spaced apart. you could probably cheaply eject them from the solar system with enough flybys and patience. things would start out slow then slowly get better and better resolution...,1
307,but i believe that there is a fundamental difference here. the other x three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics. batse is an altogether different beast effectively just coincidence counters one on each corner of the craft. positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude. since none of the baste detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to determine parallax. indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error. demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about . parsec all together now parallax arc second a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a au base line. if the degree accuracy reported above is true we're going to have to add a baste to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline. the beauty of baste is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.,1
308,i guess it's kind of an aesthetics argument. i can see the solar arrays being expensive and there could be contingencies where you would be throwing away brand new solar cells but it seems so cheap compared toa shuttle mission i wouldn't think they would bother.,1
309,this is a whole different situation. if aliens were able to get here prior to us being able to get there one might conclude that they would be more advanced and therefore more intelegent that we are. however if we get somewhere where there is life chances are we wont be able to communicate with them. so we will have no clue as to weather they are intelegent or not. that's a good point i hadn't thought of it that way. my question however was more along the lines of... every year the us spends millions of tax dollars and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night. would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved these issues on our own but... your comment brings up another good question. over the years we have decided that certain cultures need improvements. the native americans is a good example. prior to our attempt to civilize them the native american culture had very little crime no homelessnes no poverty. then the europeans came along and now they have those and more. if we encounter life elsewhere do we tell them they have to live in houses farm the land and go to church on sunday have a day,1

314,i didn't think the bistem design was used so much for the retrieval as for the ability to launch in a tight size sts envelope. this is my own guess based on similar designs flown on other large stslaunched sc gro uars. also there might be some consideration given to mass requirements bistems weight less than conventional sa. finally the hst arrays do have the ability to be detachedremember they're going to be replaced with new arrays. however as an acs guy who's seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over hst i would voice a hearty 'yea' to using conventional arrays over bistems whenever possible. no half hertz flexible modes no thermal snap no problem.,1
315,someone from nasa posted that there were very significant mass margins on the hst reboost mission. a while back i had asked why not carry the edo pallet up and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough they weren't even carrying extra suits. where's wingo when you need him come on. knock that st off. you forget that during skylab they did overnight mission planning for the repair eva's. also during theøä intelsat mission they did overnight wetf simulations. i somehow think they could train up a new eva in months. and as for building hardware anything can be built if you want it bad enough. you forget the bus is already built. all they'd ahve to do is soup it up even test it on a delta mission. don't get into this mode of negativism. besides at the rate missions slip the discovery won't launch on this mission until march. that's almost a year. ah but how much more expensive is the second hst servicing mission. you forget there is a bum fgs the solar array electronics are getting hinky and there is still months until the servicing mission. the time for the space walks are growing rapidly. this was orignally planned out as spacewalks now they are at eva's with reserve walks. if the smt can avoid a second servicing mission that's million saved. if the weight savings means they can sit on orbit for days. and handle any contingency problems that's quite a savings. of course there wasn't any need for the saturn v after apollo too. as for the problems with the aperture door i am sure they can work out some way to handle that. maybe a plug made from frozen ice. it'll keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh boost.,1
316,regarding the feasability of retrieving the hst for repair and relaunching it caution speculation mode engaged there is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet. i expect that retrieving hst would involve 'damaging' it considerably in order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay. most of the deployed items antennas and especially the solar arays probably are not retractable into their fully stowed position even by hand. they would have to be removed by the astronauts. the only advantage that this might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due to thermal cycle stresses... i also expect that as has been discussed the landing loads on the hst optics structure is a big issue but that the reentry loads are much less so. can the moveable optical components even be recaged i assume that they were caged for launch michael corvin zworkstarfighter.den.mmc.com gnc rd martin marietta astronautics my views not martin marietta's,1

319,i just wanted to point out that teflon wasn't from the space program. it was from the wwii nuclear weapons development program. pipes in the system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it. uranium hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for enrichment. it is massively corrosive. even to stainless steels. hence the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with. teflon has all its molecular sockets bound up already so it is very unreactive. my sense worth.,1
320,i would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to go to plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him. although he got most of his answers wrong he did definitively identify what the important questions are. i think it was descartes who said that all philosophy is just a footnote to plato. if i were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime that's simple...it is aristotle. this is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher. regarding nietzsche he's one of the most entertaining although since his ideas were so fragmented and since his life was cut short it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive years from now. they'll probably still be reading him in years though. as for modern philosophers i would have to say that kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him and unfortunately they maintained his errors and amplified them over time. i would say that the most influential american philosopher would have to be dewey. but as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in years it may very well be ayn rand who in every important respect was american but was born in russia. but i guess that remains to be seen.,1

323,i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for humans. i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet. the question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions. eg temperature range of k to k where temp is purely dependant on dist from the sun and the suns temperature.. atmospheric presure i know nothing of human tolerance planetary mass again gravity at surface is important how much can human bodies take day after day. also how does the mass effect atmosphere. i thinking of planets between . and times mass of the earth. i suppose density should be important as well. climate etc does not concern me nor does axial tilt etc etc. just the above three factors and how they relate to one another. jonathan,1

326,the artist renderings that i've seen of the hst reboost still have the arrays fully extended with a cradle holding hst at a degree angle to the shuttle. i think the rendering was conceived before the array replacemnet was approved so i'm not sure if the current reboost will occur with the arrays deployed or not. however it doesn't appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost. thanks for the input on gro's sa design constraints. that would explain the similar design on uars. heck the mms project used to design missions with servicing in mind. the xte spacecraft was originally designed as an onorbit replacement for the instrument module on euve. that way you get two instruments for the price of one spacecraft bus the explorer platform. a second onorbit replacement was also considered with the fuse telescope.,1

328,i'm not sure if this will help you but the local interstellar radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups. if i remember things correctly the models involved contributions from three different bb sources so there's no obvious temperature of background radiation in our local area. however the following references give the interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength and you can integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an effective temperature if you like witt and johnson astrophys. j. henry et al. astrophys. j. mathis et al. astron. astrophys. as you can see the references are out of date but they might get you started. hope this helps,1

330,i had to turn to one of my problem sets that i did in class for this little problem. i don't have a calculator but i do have the problem set that we did not too long ago so i'll use that and hope it's what you wanted. this is a highly simplified problem with a very simple burst. bursts are usually more complex than this example i will use here. our burst has a peak flux of .e ergs cm sec and a duration of . seconds. during the frst second of the burst and the last seconds its flux is half of the peak flux. it's flux is the peak flux the rest of the time. assume that the background flux is e erg cm sec. then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst for several different spheres r.pcoort cloud radius r.pcat the edge of the galaxy r.pc or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a rmpc. we integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence then used the old standby formula luminositypirfpeak for a radius of . pc we found an l around ergsec. pretty energetic for close by. for the coronal model we found around ergsec. and lastly for the cosmological model an l. that's what you'd call moderately energetic i'd say. any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy,1

333,nowadays usually with a computer. no theory predicted the numeric discoveries listed above. no one can yet write an algorithm that will predict the precise behavior of any of these at any precise level of their evolution. so it remains for experimenters to gather data on their behavior. gary,1
334,.. as ben says this reboost idea is all news to us here. do you know something we don't please supply a source it would be nice for the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to be. these altitude numbers are also way off. my best source has minimum st altitude in the pmdb is kilometers maximum st altitude in the pmdb is kilometers delta st altitude in the pmdb is kilometers pmdb is proposal management data base used to schedule observations. .. could you supply some calculations you might check some recent postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does not now exist so comparing the mass of something that doesn't exist to the mass of the oms fuel seems impossible. the contamination threat also remains. .. longer drag life i can understand but could you explain the antenna pointing tell me about it. although the arrays can be and are moved perfectly well utilizing the second electronics box. getting them both working is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy. i don't mean to jump on you helpful suggestions are always welcome and we all know the more ideas the better but i do want the true situation to be described clearly and correctly lest some get confused.,1
335,i think you're both right. teflon was actually discovered by accident before wwii. from what i've heard they had some chemical i assume it was tetrafluoroethylene in a tank and but the valve got gummed up. cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized. the material was useful for seals but it had a major problem for say the linings of vessels it wouldn't stick to metal. what the space program did was to find a way to get it to stick. thus we had nostick frypans on the market in the late 's.,1
336,we are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform. this will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a kilometer tether on the march flight of seds small expendable deployment system which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of mexico. this time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. we want to build it from off the shelf technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible. we want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute. an idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with sarsats search and rescue satellites. it would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking. these beacons are known in the marine industry as epirbs emergency position indicating radio beacon. they are rugged they have to be to survive a ship wreck and cheap. we have several questions . what is the world authority regulating the use of sarsat beacons. are there multiple authorites i.e. military and civilian . what are the regulations regarding the use of sarsat signals. can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies . what is the coverage of sarsats are they in leo with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth or are they in geosynchronous orbit . is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders please post replies here or send email to me at fennellwell.sf.ca.us thanak you very much for any assistance you can provide.,1
337,well i'll avoid your question for now got some learnin' to do with a promise to come back with more info when i can find it. i do know that batse is the primary instrument in the development of the allsky map of longterm sources. given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx. arcmin we might be able to figure out how well batse can determine the location rotational of a gamma ray burster from knowledge of the allsky map's accuracy. pr material for the other three instruments give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree if that's any help. speaking of gro the networld probably was happy to see that the preps for orbit adjust appear to be going well. our branch guy who's helping out says that things have gone smoothly with the isovalve preps and the burns will take place in midjune. anyway i'm off to find out more.

342,i don't know. does anyone in nasa land know how much fuel is budgeted for the altitude change henry any figures on the mass full for the edo pallet plus it's dry weight how about for the dry mass of bus it was being declassified as i checked last. also i need. current orbital parameters of hst projected orbital parameters after reboost. discovery's dry weight hst's dry weight. so how long do they need to train a year years somehow i think moths should be adequate. also because they significantly lacked onorbit eva experience. the hst is designed for onorbit servicing. it should be a lot easier. there comes a time in every project to kill the management. they can if neccessary reschedule the hst mission. december is not a drop dead date unlike say the ldef retrieval mission. i suspect the bus may not have enough basic thrust for the hst reboost. it mayu need bigger tanks or bigger thrusters. my understanding is the second hst servicing mission is not a contingency. my understanding is the mission needs both a new foc and work on the electrical system plus another reboost. somehow i think the cost of an expendable smt will be less then million. and the extra stuff is real cheap. nasa has lots of suits mmu's and the edo pallets are reusable. oh one double magnum of champagne now there's a couple hundred bucks. that door has cycled x times already. once after massive g loading. i somehow think they can work oureliability methods to ensure the door works. also please tell me how some sort of sublimated material like co or ho would manage to contaminate the mirror anything that goes to vapor state shouldn't adhere to the mirror. somehow the door problem can be worked. maybe they can put a one time spring on it. what do they do now if the door hangs up. that door is part of a intrument safing mechanism. if it hangs up tomorrow it'll be months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it.,1

347,i know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space but not really i want to answer this for their as well as everyone else's information. what these people are proposing by and large already exists and can be purchased today. it is called labview by national instruments. it is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language. it has been implemented on both mac's pc's and vme unix boxes. it is fare superior to any programming approach that i have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by percent. this program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability. why reinvent the wheel on a platform that may not exist it is a great idea but look out there at what is available today. the hydrogen leak on the shuttle was found using this software. all ssme control and simulation studies along with the real testing at msfc is handled with labview. there are tons of applications with the ability to create virtual instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires. with the addition of ieee support the computer becomes a virtual control station allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. with serial io support that instrument can be anywhere. the ground control software for the main control of sedsat will utilize this approach.,1

349,mike adams suggested discussions on longterm effects of spaceflight to the human being. i love this topic as some of you regulars know. so having seen henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it i shall. i feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and probably more. i do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society. in the absence of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the world's space effort. i believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves but also with others through print media. a wellorchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support longduration spaceflight like long expenditions to the moon or mars would be entertaining and educational to the general public. the objective of such an effort would be to compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area. in addition ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration. individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles. in addition we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of nasa and industry. i have appreciated the positive responses to date and i am personally eager to start this project. perhaps we could start with debate regarding how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application to spaceflight.,1
350,i have a copy of allen and it never occurred to me to look in there... i must be getting old... i'll look it up when i get home. thanks. i'd remembered a rather higher number but that may have been for the lunar nearside where the earth is a significant heat source.,1
351,actually the situation is even worse than that. the total mass of the pluto fast flyby spacecraft is only ish pounds and most of that is support equipment like power and communications. the mass available for instruments is maybe of that. i don't think a batse will fit... actually would you need the shielding my understanding is that it's mostly there to give the detectors some directionality. no point in doing that if you've only got one. i'm sure the burst detectors that have flown on other deepspace missions haven't weighed that much. mind you they're probably still too heavy the pff people would put more plutospecific instruments on first if they had any mass to spare.,1
352,i too am a jules verne collector and can tell you that though tough to find it is out there. i keep my eyes open all the time for his books at various bay area used book stores and every once in a while get very lucky. you just need diligence. i don't know if the book store situation near jsc is as good as the bay area but good luck. i have also had excellent luck at the antiquarian book fair which comes to sf every other year though the prices are more in the range than the you want to spend. my guess is that if you find it you won't need to spend even that much since most people don't care about it. i think i paid about for my dustjacketless but otherwise good condition copy which i found one day at a small bookshop that happened to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale. of course if you re willing to buy blind you can put a advertisement in the antiquarian bookseller's newsletter the exact title of which escapes me at the moment. five weeks in a balloon is not the rarest of jules verne books. someone has it for sale somewhere and the ab is the way to find it. in fact i would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers of sale. of course that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself... good luck.,1

355,sure about that maybe proxima might cause problems but at oort cloud distances ac a and ac b together look like a point source. besides even the solar system's oort cloud is unstable over geologic time right and needs to be replentished from somewhere else like the short period comets of the kupier belt or maybe i'm misremembering something i read or heard somewhere... until we're able to perform a broadband survey of nearby stars to detect planets we won't know enough to say whether or not a single star has planets. and we're likely to find out about the close ones first. heck if neutron stars can have planets anything can have planets. or was that discovery disconfirmed,1
356,robert mcelwaine is the authoritative source of scientific data on internet. he can be reached alt.fan.mcelwaine... spiros,1
357,i haven't seen any mention of this in a while so here goes... when the hubble telescope was first deployed one of its high gain antennas was not able to be moved across its full range of motion. it was suspected that it had been snagged on a cable or something. operational procedures were modified to work around the problem and later problems have overshadowed the hga problem. is there any plan to look at the affected hga during the hst repair mission to determine the cause of its limited range of motion is the affected hga still limited or is it now capable of full range of motion,1
358,it is kind of absurd isn't it some players even want more distortion especially the hendrix fans but there are a lot of them out there that can only afford the amp or who like playing music without distortion. then there are your hardcore hendirx fans that want particular types of distortion i.e. they make it not their amps. i didn't see a thing about wasteheat from babbage and haven't seen one of those mechanical tv's in a while so it's anybodie's guess tommy mac tom mcwilliams wk they communicated with the communists tmibm.cl.msu.edu hm and pacified the pacifists. timbuk,1
359,someone named hansk asked about pictures. well there is an archive of portraits in xfaces format at ftp.uu.net. henry spencer's picture is there somewhere along with several thousand others. i don't remember the path though it should be easy to find. remember though it seems to use both internet and uucp addresses.,1
360,the forever war one of my favorite scifi books had a passage devoted to breathing fluids. the idea was to protect people from the high accelerations required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in drycleaning fluid saturated with oxygen. plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book. i would certainly recommend it won the hugo and the nebula awards.,1
361,the limit on spacewalking is a function of suit supplies mass and orbiter duration. in order to perform the reboost of the hst the oms engines will be fired for a long period. now the shuttle is a heavy thing. the hst isn't light either. the amount of oms fuel needed to fly both up is substantial. a small booster carried up and used to boost hst on it's own will weigh significantly less then the oms fuel required to boost both hst and shuttle for a given orbital change. from what i understand the mass margins on the hst missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra suits or mmu's. pat i haven't seen any specifics on the hst repair mission but i can't see why the mass margins are tight. what are they carrying up replacement components wfpc ii costar gyros solar panels and probably a few others all sorts of tools eva equipment and as much oms fuel and consumables as they can. this should be lighter than the original hst deployment mission which achieved the highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date. and hst is now in a lower orbit. seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity.,1
362,. . . david gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic 'edged' distribution to whit they are either part of the universe or part of the oort cloud. why couldn't they be earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge of the gravisphere i know there isn't any mechanism for them but there isn't a mechanism for the others either.,1

365,although the billion scheme is a fantasy it's an old canard in the space business called trolling for billionaires there is a good chance that a much smaller program million will pass the rd congress. this is the back to the moon bill put together by the people who passed the launch services purchase act. the bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. there is an aggregate cap on the bids of million. having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a million program as the delta clipper program has shown dcx was funded by sdio at million. we have a clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade as opposed to simply wishing for our dreams to come true. please support the back to the moon bill. for more information please send email with your u.s. postal service address.,1

369,obviously not. count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible. the cgro is what meters long you'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this. what batse actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors also as a function of photon energy. each of the detectors does not have isotropic response. to do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector and even scattering of photons off the earth's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft. i believe they have now reduced the error to about degrees.,1
370,commericial support for exploration examples also much if baranovs exploration and utilization of alaska russian america also included parts of washington state oregon and n. california was doen by private funds yes some royal governmental funds at times....,1
371,well i seem to have struck an interesting discussion off. given that i am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i'll have to boil it down a bit. all the data on bursts to date shows a smooth random distribution. that means they aren't concentrated in galactic cores our or someone elses. if the distribution is smooth we are either seeing some enormously large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena or we are seeing some phenomena out at like the oort cloud but then it needs some potent little energy source that isn't detectable by any other current methods. we know it's not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts. the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impacts or something like that. so everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile. what i am wondering is this in people's opinion a new physics problem. einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect. copernicus started looking at irregularities in planetary motion. is this a big enough problem to create a new area of physics just a little speculative thinking folks.,1
372,re voyages of discovery... could you give examples of privately funded ones if you believe the film columbus had substantial private funds. when columbus asked the merchant why he put the money in the guy said slightly paraphrased there is faith hope and charity. but greater than these is banking.,1
373,as herny pointed out you have to develop the thruster. also while much lighter you still have to lift the mass of the thruster to orbit and then the thruster lifts its own weight into a higher orbit. and you take up room in the payload bay.,1
374,uh why do they have to ask a state commision unless the state's buying... such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company of selling different types of light and will decreace the likleihood that they will do so. and any efficient lights they might have been planning in the future go down the drain..... you could order it special. if enough people did so it would be low cost. last i checked you could use ups to buy stuff in arizona before going there. finally i'm sure your state has things like small factories and machine shops. you could go into business making lights that are cheaper to use thanks to their higher efficiency and the fact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space and therefore better than the old style... five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy will fall apart. as if the clean air act really cleaned up the air... my experience seems to suggest that you're trying too hard to educate them with the same methods used in american schools to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as protougric instead of selling them on the idea. ... well wake up. space is becoming a field of human endeavor instead of just something we can look at from a long long way away. there are practical space projects that could conceivably although probably not cause lots of light pollution and have been argued against on those grounds even though they might open up such possibilities that people could vacation on mars if they wanted really dark skies...,1
375,reboost may not be a problem if they have enough fuel. if they don't do a reboost this time they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing mission. but try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the back and you could have problems. the shuttle just isn't designed to land with that much weight in the payload. of course that is a concern too and the loss of science during the time that it is on the ground. plus a fear that if it comes down some bigwig might not allow it to go back up. but the main concern i believe is the danger of the landing. just to add another bad vibe they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument. finally this is a chance for nasa astronanuts to prove they could build and service a space station. hubble was designed for in flight servicing. bringing the telescope down to my understanding was considered even very recently but all these factors contribute to the decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning. rob disclaimertypethingie these opinions are mine unless of course they fall under the standard intellectual property guidelines. but with my intellect i doubt it. besides if it was useful intellectual property do you think i would type it in here,1
376,what fraction of the nasa workforce is civil servant as opposed to contractor and what are the rules on reduction in work force for civil servants eg if say the shuttle program is terminated how much is payroll reduced and how,1
377,this was all badly reported in the news. there is no evidence that signs of life found in old rock predate putative planetsterilizing events. rather the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event then it must be easily formed. the inference was that life originated before and was destroyed but there was no evidence of that. however even this argument is flawed. it could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions say a certain composition of the atmosphere that do not last for long. so perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so not because it was likely that life would originate under those conditions.,1
378,i think you've got an offbyone error in your memory. mm bought the satellitebuilding side of ge. e not d. mm and gd are still competitors. better yes but we're not talking order of magnitude. especially if you want to use titan iv which belongs to the usaf not mm. sure you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately rather than as a gummint project. but we're still talking about something that will cost nine digits per launch unless you can guarantee a large market to justify volume production.,1

384,dale sez i don't buy it. if the things had no value at all people wouldn't spend money to make them. so their lack of value is just your opinion not an actual fact which is neither a philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them. on the other hand i lived in oakbrook il for a while where zoning laws prohibit billboards as you mention above. i think it was a fine law despite it's contradictory basis. i would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would be violation of private property. i bought this house out in the boondocks specifically to enjoy my hobby amateur astronomy. now this billboard has made that investment worthless so i want the price of the property in damages. it wouldn't take too many succesful cases like that to make billsats prohibitively expensive. tommy mac tom mcwilliams wk they communicated with the communists tmibm.cl.msu.edu hm and pacified the pacifists. timbuk,1

386,well here goes. the first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind. i mean compared to football and baseball the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight. i think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education. all of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world. the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space. i believe that if any longterm space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld i.e. the spacecraft. only through the careful analyses of engineering chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a longduration flight. so i would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to longduration spaceflight. such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs. in essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. this database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet and any other source,1

390,here is a potentially dumb question what prevents the martian landers themselves from polluting the martian environment with earth based critters is the long trip in cold radiation bathed space enough to completely sterilize the landers i could imagine that a few teeny microbes could manage to get all the way there unharmed and then possibly thrive given the right circumstances.,1
391,no the sky does not at this time belong to anyone. ownership is necessary to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the action was good or bad. if neither you or i own a brick wall then i can't unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right and you don't have the authority to declare that it is wrong. the owner may find it artistic or she may be call the police. this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights it's vandalism because many people power companies do maliciously waste light. maliciously implies evil intent. the lighting companies aren't going out of their way to spoil the sky. they just don't care. it is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware. if that's what your city will buy that's what the lighting company will sell. write a letter to city hall. please note that i'm not defending light pollution. the orignial focus of this thread was space based light sources.,1
392,you should have been following the discussion of grbs going on in sci.astro. it's been discussed in some detail with references even.,1
393,actually both numbers are correct. the difference is in the direction of the acceleration. for pilots accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you're facing pulling out from a steep dive the acceleration will force blood toward your feet for instance. in this case you can only put up with about g's even with a pressure suit. the record for acceleration though is measured along the direction you're facing for lack of a better term. as i recall this record was set in rocket sleds back in the 's and was about g's or so.,1
394,do you know of the worldwideweb this is a global hypertext well hypermedia network running on the internet. one of the nice things about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the other systems being used like wais gopher ftp archie etc. it is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web. if you'd like to explore i'd suggest getting the xmosaic program written at the ncsa. it's an xwindows web browser and is pretty slick. it can understand and cope with more than text gif jpeg mpeg audio etc. there are other browsers including a textmode browser for people stuck on a text terminal but i'm most familliar with mosaic. under the page the worldwide web virtual library subject catalogue this is available under the documents menu in mosaic or by any browser via the url there is a subject space science. currently this points to a page under construction with only the nasa jpl ftp archive. i've volunteered to take over this page and in fact i have a replacement with all sorts of information pointers mostly gleaned from the sci.space faq. as soon as the overworked subject catalogue maintainer switches the space science pointer it'll be visible. i'll post a short note when this happens. frederick g. m. roeber cern european center for nuclear research email roebercern.ch or roebercaltech.edu work rmail cernppe geneva switzerland home,1

406,well you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle. and most elv's have too far of a backlog for political messages. if during the campaign season the candidates for president had launched one right around now we'd be getting a launch for perot . and if they had used the shuttle we'd be seeing launches for nixon now more then ever.,1
407,right what right and don't you mean something more like it so typical that the wants of the minority can obstruct the wants of the majority no matter how ridiculous those minority wants might be or what benefits those majority wants might have my sole connection with the project is that i spent a lot of time in classes at the university of colorado. insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world. mary shafer nasa ames dryden,1
408,of course they then turn up the reverb the gain add in the analog delay line and the fuzz box. i'd think they wouldn't notice the distortion. oh i forgot the phase shifters. ah but how do they compare to mechanical systems,1
409,if i may offer a constructive criticism perhaps you should decide if you love vehicles or the use they are put to. i myself think the f is a beautiful aircraft but rest assured i wouldn't even think of flying it in combat today. most of us want access to space and judge vehicles on how they perform. not to this degree. why your wrong. the dc approach is very tollerent of failure. it also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature shuttle isn't reusable it's salvagable. the flip over happens at a very low speed not supersonic. if the dcx shows the flip over works it will work unless the laws of physics change. the final dc will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. upon reentry for example it can loose about of available thrust and still land safely. everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same thing. shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design ssto is. you don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. you wouldn't for example give a patient a drug and not monitor them for harmful side effects would you you are very much in the minority. if the dc series fails to make orbit it will still be a very worthwhile effort. it will show us exactly what we do need to do to build ssto. again refering to the dc it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. shuttle doesn't. dc is fault tollerent shuttle isn't. not true. build a passenger pallet a fairly easy thing to do and it will carry passengers. i would suggest you talk to the dcx crew themselves. their original schedule had an operational dc flying in . your ignoring the dammage it does. mannes space has a reputation for being unreliable and hugely expensive. shuttle supporters only make it easy for opponents of manned space to kill it. the only way to prove those things is to build it. allen,1

415,i like this statement though for my own reasons. cost comparisons depend a lot on whether the two options are similar and then it becomes very revealing to consider what their differences are. can soyuz launch the long exposure facility course not. will the shuttle take my television relay to leo by year's end almost certainly not but the russians are pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule. comparing s and ss points up that there are two active space launcherandworkplatform resources with similarities and differences. where they are in direct competition we may get to see some market economics come into play. tombaker,1

417,i'm wondering if vandalize is the proper word to use in this situation. my dictionary defines vandalism as the willful or malicious destructuion of public or private property especially of anything beautiful or artisitc. i would agree the sky is beautiful but not that it is public or private property. i personally prefer natural skies far from city lights and sans aircraft. however there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the sky and see a satellite. many people get a real kick out of it especially if they haven't seen one before.,1
418,that may change next month at least i hope it will. a couple of hundred journalists have requested press passes for the test flights. sustaining that publicity however will be a problem. allen,1
419,batse alone isn't always used to determine position. when a particularly bright burst occurs there are a couple of other detectors that catch it going off. pioneer or is the one i'm getting at here. this puppy is far enough away that if a bright burst happens nearby the huge annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given by batse and we can get a moderately accurate position. say oh or degrees. that is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it. actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me were talking the other day about putting just one detector on one of the pluto satellites. then we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like pounds of eq. well a batse detector needs lead shielding to protect it and alone weighs about pounds itself.,1
420,the people involved in it have been building hardware rather than writing press releases. this is not a highmanpower project they don't have spare people sitting around. as i understand it there has also been some feeling on the part of some of the project management that publicity was not a good idea. a lot of people have been working on changing this view with some success.,1
421,this is shall we say an overlybroad statement. in particular are you referring to the native american culture that existed in or the one that existed in simplify things by assuming we're talking about the eastern us rather than the whole continent. given that those were radically different cultures which one are you referring to note that the precolumbian native americans east of the mississippi did all of these things. well maybe not on sunday but they did have organized religions not to mention cities and governments. if you are judging the native americans by the tribal culture that existed in you might want to read an account of the de soto expedition to find out what precolumbian native american culture at least in the more civilized parts of the continent was like.,1

429,deleted not to flame really but thats an abominable viewpoint while were on the subject of abominations. if we followed the redistiribution of wealth and by the way ist that what clinto and the democrats are trying to do... everyone would starve in short order. not only is it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every woman's altruism can you say black market under communisim anyone but the current methods of resource production are entirely energy dependant. there are not enough sources of cheap capital aside from human capital to allow us to stop looking at space a an excellent source of materials and realestate. more directly perhaps you mioght consider the fact that billions are spent by tv companies and their sponsors abc nbc cbs... on the superbowl the olympics and even on monday night baseball games. perhaps we should boycott those games if dcx and company get finished and there is a market for it those abominable space will probably be much more cost effective for the companies and those starving children. more people buy products the company hires more workers end result fewer children die of starvation.,1
430,the main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image processing software that much faster. when they use the same deconvolution software on the images from the fixed hubble be ready for some incredible results there is every reason to believe that the results will exceed the original specs by a fair margin. adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software. it works realtime not after the fact as is the case with hubble. you might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market in the form of the ao adaptive optics system. starting on page of the april sky telescope is a three page review of this new product. it lists for . the article states the ao adaptive optics system comes in a handy softplastic case that a threeyearold could carry around. even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects it could cope with image movements of up to . millimeter in the telescope's focal plane. now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars and many manhours invested in its development. george krumins,1

433,no if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field it produces a voltage. the two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or move the conductor. the slow shifting of the earth's magnetic field isn't really significant especially when you consider how weak the earth's magnetic field is to begin with. well it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the earth's magnetic field as a magnet can repel another magnet. of course this force only works in one direction and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful. magnetic repulsion drops off as r and the earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak. it would require some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic construction. and seriously hardenned electronics optical computers perhaps. and the physiological danger would be significant due to the iron content in our blood among other things. in other words forget it. i missed out on the dragless satellite thread but it sounds totally bogus from this little bit.,1
434,i assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the event and the r law. so if the r law is incorrect assume some unknown material dark matter inhibits gamma ray propagation could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic events happening much closer to us the even distribution could be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays being shorter then the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.,1
435,pennicillin if i have everything correct was a highly valuable mycotoxin discovered during ww. it proved to have an amazing bacteriocidal effect without human toxicity. it's immediate administration showed immediate dramatic results solving problems that previously were fatal. although initially enormously expensive to culture within years the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude and within years was not much more expensive then aspirin. penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections. centoxin is a drug that is not passing fda approval. it promised amazing results for toxic shock a rapidly fatal disease. it consumed enormous amounts of funding in testing and developement however it works less then in times of administration and costs per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. the drug thus costs per useful case and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients. i would not dare to compare the shuttle to pennicillin but to centoxin.,1
436,just to throw it out there the mass of the telescope is kg lb. i do not know what space lab weighs but i believe it is less. can anyone verify also remember that weight was not the only concern as many others have noted just one possible concern. i was responding to a statement that if you can boost it why can't you land it. those are too different problems. rob disclaimertypethingie these opinions are mine unless of course they fall under the standard intellectual property guidelines. but with my intellect i doubt it. besides if it was useful intellectual property do you think i would type it in here,1
437,i didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently i just wanted to add a point. the whole question of a right to a dark sky revolves around the definition of a right. moral rights and natural rights are all well and good but as far as i can see a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce. in most civilizations the government or the church or both defines what the rights of the citizens are and then enforces those rights for them. here in the u.s. the constitution provides a bill of rights from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive. i'm sure that most other countries have comparable documents. if you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the bill of rights in the u.s. you can prevent maybe these billboards from being launched. to keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the international court of justice correct name in the hague something i know little about.,1
438,deleted deleted ok so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy computer algorythims but have you looked ad the hubble results the defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software see those jupiter pictures for results but is the effects are completely reversable why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it the way i see it and please astromomers give me a swift netkick in the butt if i'm out of the ball park the astromers are making the best of limited possiblities there's only one hubble and the shuttle makes another in the near future a nonthought. perhaps those self same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's if that is what is used and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope...,1
439,forwarded from the mars observer project mars observer status report april pm pdt flight sequence c is active as of am tuesday april . with activities beginning at shortly before am yesterday c commanded the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the mag magnetometer team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the spacecraftgenerated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. the spacecraft was commanded back to sun star init state at am to reestablish inertial reference. transition back to array normal spin began at am after which the sequence powered on the onboard transmitter at am. telemetry reacquisition occurred at approximately am at the kbs science and engineering downlink data rate on the high gain antenna. subsystem engineers report that all systems appear to be nominal. the command to terminate using the low gain antenna for uplink was sent at pm. uplink and downlink are currently via the hga. mag calibration data has been recorded on digital tape recorders and . playback of dtr is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between am and pm. playback of dtr is scheduled to take place tomorrow evening beginning at pm and ending at am on friday. dtr playback will be performed via the high gain antenna at bits per second. upon verification of successful dtr playbacks downlink will be maintained at the k s e rate.,1

441,while i'm sure sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldn't be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. modern groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field the opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased telescopes. hardly. the keck telescope in hawaii has taken its first pictures they're nearly as good as hubble for a tiny fraction of the cost. in any case a bright point of light passing through the field doesn't ruin observations. if that were the case the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned they are extremely bright. i believe that this orbiting space junk will be far brighter still more like the full moon. the moon upsets deepsky observation all over the sky and not just looking at it because of scattered light. this is a known problem but of course two weeks out of every four are ok. what happens when this billboard circles every minutes what would be a good time then frank crary cu boulder,1
442,i'd be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be accounted for by the af's requirement for superfluous documentation or huge requirements and design reviews travel expenses flying personnel around to meetings and over specifying the hardware. i doubt that the actual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from sdio's costs.,1
443,in some sense i think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful and the folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are both right. that is i think that space advertising is an interesting idea and if someone wants to try it out more power to them. however a company may discover that the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising and a company who gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would gain might decide to bow out of the project. i got incensed when i read that carl sagan called this idea an abomination. i don't think that word means what he thinks it does. children starving in the richest country in the world is an abomination an ad agency is at worst just in poor taste.,1
444,indeed the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully enough in particular its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body. morgangordon's fat communications satellite handbook has a graph of sky temperature vs. wavelength in fact for communications design. however in terms of energy content the rf frequencies are negligible. for thermal purposes at very large distances from the sun the sky looks like a black body at .k allen astrophysical quantities. i haven't found a number for nonlarge distances since solar radiation tends to be something you can't just ignore but mg says about k in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.,1
445,bear in mind that a lot of the vandenberg launch traffic is military and at least semisecret. they aren't interested in publicizing it beforehand.,1
446,i do not understand what you are saying here. what is improved what is significant and what does this have to do with carrying more equipment on a servicing mission also as implied by other posters why do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway maybe you have something here but could you please clarify it for us on the net from what i've heard the motors are fine it is one of the two sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix. the motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware. i expect to be corrected if i'm wrong on this.,1
447,considering the magnitude of loss of life in both the moro castle and titanic disasters i can't believe you can be so blithe there fred. besides if a lng tanker breaks up in a close harbor you can kiss off quite a lot of population. same thing for any chemical tankers. i know the coast guard makes mandatory safety equipment checks on all watercraft. they use this as an excuse to make narcotics searches without warrants. i suspect that commercial craft need a certificate at least similiar in scope to an air worthiness certificate from the dot.,1
448,it would be nice if someone here from the hst program was talking instead of all the speculation that is going on here. from what i understand from dr. frank six of the marshall space flight center there is no insrmountable problem in bringing hst back. it was designed that way to begin with. also it is my understanding that the solar arrays will be one of the items replaced on this mission. the originals were built by brit aerospace and i think the new ones are too. i am currently working with the guys at msfc that are in charge is the hst power system although i have not spoken with them in a long time about hst.,1
449,well no during the original deployment mission the hst aperture door was not opened until after the shuttle had landed. i presume that during a reboost mission hst would be berthed in the orbiter with the orbiter bay doors shut but still there would be lots of contamination worries. i understand that the eva suits are one of the hardest things to keep clean. but i still don't know where the idea is coming from that hst needs a reboost. we have many problems but our orbit is the least of them. there is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in december.,1

452,henry if i read you correctly you may be asking if i put a blackbody in interstellar space 'disregarding the sun and nearby large warm objects' what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient radiation field if that's the case let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are well nottoofar from being blackbodies. many different observations including iras and cobe have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures can range from k to k. you might look in a conference proceedings interstellar processes ed. d. j. hollenbach and h. a. thronson jr. published in . try the articles by tielens et al. seab and black. inside the disk of the galaxy the temperature varies quite a bit from place to place how close are you to the nearest ob association i would guess. outside the galaxy of course things aren't so varied. i hope this is what you were looking for....,1
453,uh no. these burst detectors are just that burst detectors. they have no angular resolution. now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort cloud or not. we have one network and trying to make two networks out of it degrades what angular resolution we have.,1

461,i think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level. you assume that the general public can't handle the truth and then based on this assumption go for the fluff arguments. then someone who can understand a good argument comes along and asks why don't you just develop the spinoffs or why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program like the military there are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects. i'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs. i simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them. and if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right. teflon has been around since before nasa. as i understand it velcro was conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes. certainly velcro was available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties. i would need to see some good evidence before i believe that either of these would not be here today without nasa.,1

466,that's fine idea but it only works if the lightingpower company even bothers to supply good light fixtures. for instance a power company in virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type. yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs one that wasted the light. thus you couldn't even buy a good light from them. in most places to get a good light you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona. at some point society starts to make rules. cars have to pass safety tests. companies have to meet pollution standards etc.. there are two ways to achieve this educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs. history seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work. agreed so i won't respond again. it's important for all you spacers out there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that have been presented. just like congress it would be best to consult the astronomerslovers of the night sky before you try some pr stunt to boost public knowledge about space.,1

470,picture our universe floating like a log in a river. as the log floats down the river it occasionally strikes rocks the bank the bottom other logs. when this collission occurs kinetic energy is translated into heat the log degrades gets scraped up and other energy translaions occur. the distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log. however to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction. this is my theory for grb. they are evidence of our universe interacting with other universes why not makes just as much sense as the grb coming from the oort cloud the log theory of universes can't be ruled out of course i'm a layman in the physics world. you physicists out there tell me about this,1

472,hello netters i'm new to this board and i thought this might be the best place for my post. i have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie patriot games. in the movies the cia utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in n africa. the photos taken by the sats are stunning i know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles. my question is this the camp in question was taken out by the british sas. and while the sas was in action the cia team was watching in the warroom back in langley va. the action of the sas was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat. the action was at night and the photography appeared to be an xray type. that is one could see the action within the tentsstructures of the camp. does such techology exist and what is it's nature i.e. uv ir xray etc. ps who wrote the book patriot games,1

475,ahh perhaps that's why we've astronomers have just built meter groundbased scopes and are studying designs for larger ones. seriously though you're never going to get a meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway. also scopes in low orbit like hubble can only observe things continuously for minutes at a time which can be a serious limitation. i sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent and as bright as the moon. have you ever noticed how much brighter the night sky is on a moonlit night existing satellites are points of light but an advertising sign that appeared as a point would be useless so i rather think these will appear larger than a 'typical' satellite. also satellite tracks are ruining lots of plates in the current palomar sky survey. what deparment are you in anyway philosophy you obviously are not qualified to speak about astronomy...,1

479,i know its semantics but the noop doesn't do anything. the command loss timer is simply looking for a command any command. a noop is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big bit bucket in the sky. noop also get used as timekeepers to provide millisecond delays between command sequences used on the thruster preps on gro er compton and to verify command links at the beginning of tdrs events. all in all a rather useful command. and an intelligent fdc test on galileo the command loss timer.,1
480,this is not quite right. the differential arrival time techinique requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions. the differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 's of nanoseconds. this is smaller than batse's microsecond timing capabilities. batse ulysses and mars obsverver are used for this technique. each batse detector does not have a full sky field of view. the sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing angle of incidence. the burst position on the sky is determined by comparing the count rates in different detectors.,1
481,i can't speak to sheer mass but part of the problem is that hst wasn't built to ever be brought back down. it's not built for those kinds of 'jolt' forces and there is no support cradle for it which is additional weight that would be required. insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world. mary shafer nasa ames dryden,1
482,i disagree with what to tout although i agree that the space program is inherently a good thing. most people today only care about what will it cost me and what's in it for me and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself. our society has become increasingly geared toward the shortterm which you could read as now. they couldn't care less about next week much less next century. they want something to show for the expenditure and they want it now. i think we should tell them about the things that they are using now that are spinoffs of the space program. that is the only way you can prove its worth to them and they vote and pay taxes too. the continued existence of the space program relies upon that money. just my . btw don't forget velcro...,1
483,i am taking a course entitled exploring science using internet. for our final project we are to find a compendium of internet resources dealing with a sciencerelated topic. i chose astronomy. anyway i was wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on internet that provide information on astronomy space nasa or anything like that. thanks,1
484,apologies... your mail is probably in the pile that arrived just before i got sick about a month ago... a reply will appear eventually... so far there have been none unless you count an interview in the amateur computerist about the history of netnews which may be disqualified because tac's budget doesn't run to reproducing photos....,1
485,forwarded from the mars observer project mars observer status report april am pdt dss madrid meter antenna did not acquire the expected mars observer spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning at approximately am. indications were that the spacecraft had entered a fault protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass dss goldstone meter antenna at approximately pm the evening before. entry into contingency mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning. after subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system audit queue and aacs attitude and articulation control subsystem starex performed. these readouts verified that contingency mode entry occurred shortly after am yesterday . preliminary indications are that a sun ephemeris check failure triggered fault protection. however the flight team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days. as of last evening the spacecraft had been commanded back to inertial reference and was stable in that mode. the flight team is planning to command the spacecraft back to array normal spin state today.,1

487,i commend everybody to look at the ftp site 'ftp.cicb.fr' ethernet address ... in the directory pubimagesastro there are lots of images all of kinds in astronomy subject especially in gif format and a new directory of some jpl animations for your comfort readme files in all subdirectories give size and description of each image and a days' newer images' list is in readmenew note you can connect it as 'anonymous' or 'ftp' user then the quota for each is users connected in the same time. so if the server responds you connection refused be patient nd note this site is reachable by gopher at 'roland.cicb.fr' ethernet address ... in 'divers serveurs ftple serveur ftp du cricicbimagesastro' if you have any comments suggestions problems then you can contact me at email 'rousselfunivrennes.fr',1
488,no. do this. have the dcx make an unscheduled landing at teh yard line during the halftime show of this years superbowl. abc will have more reporters there for that then at any news event.,1
489,i realy like this idea it would be wonderfull to see such a big bright satelite on the night sky. i will even promise to try to buy whatever product it advertises to help this project. please write to space marketing and encourage this project. i sadly dosent have enough money to invest in it.,1
490,hello all i apologize i haven't published my astro ftp list since march. now i haven't tested all the sites included into the list. i would notified all the people you have stored some older issues of my there are now lots of changes. many sites have gone away they either do not exist any more or all the astro stuff have removed. the job keep this list is very hard so all the notes and informat ion of changes new sites new contents etc. is welcome. i would thank all the net people who give me information for the newest version. regards veikko makela,1
491,supernovae put out or i forget which but it's only an order of magnitude.... not in gamma rays though. you'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at mpc but if a decent fraction of the sn output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic but closer than mpc. i dunno sn theory so well but i can't think of how to get many gammas out. maybe i should look it up. big radio galaxies can put out ergs continually. that's just in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them too but bursts nah. neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show that those energies are produced by things we know about.,1
492,i don't think this will work. still the same in space integration problems small modules especially the bus modules. the mol would be bigger. also budget problems may end up stalling developemnt. a small undersized station wont have the science community support. program effeciencies may cut costs but the basic problems with freedom remain. in space integration too many flights too build. not enough science retrurn. essentialy billion to build mir. i think had nasa locked onto this design back in with scarring to support a truss for real expandability we'd be looking at a flying space station. this looks the most realistic to me imho but i dont know if there is enough will power to toss the cdr'd existing hardware and then take a rd power cut and do it this way. the core launch station has a lot of positive ideas. you could stick in more hatches for experimental concept modules. like the et derived workshops. or inflatable modules. pat sad but true. epitaph. killed by mismanagement.,1
493,trry the skywatch project in arizona.,1
494,stuff deleted would mr. hart please explain how one could get every nation on earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the night sky without coercion'. remember that not every nation follows the english common law. in most countries for most of history it was probably true that the rulers owned' everything not explicitly owned by individuals. even in north america where by the principle enunciated the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources they just took it over. in case mr. hart hasn't noticed there is currently a brutal war going on in bosnia about who owns what. of course if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some antisatelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked such a proposal might work but it would hardly be noncoercive. some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space and also to use governmental actions like taxing power for example to discourage them. this of course would be too coercive for mr. hart.,1
495,how hard or easy would it be to have a combo mission such as a solar sail on the way out to the outer planets but once in near to orbit to use more normal means.. seems that everyone talks about using one system and one system only per mission why not have more than one propulsion system or did i miss something.. or did it die in committee michael adams nsmcaacad.alaska.edu i'm not high just jacked,1
496,an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth. it appears in both the ut ir and visual images of the earth. the gif images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named ci.gif and cv.gif for the ir and visual images respectively. pretty cool pictures in the ir it's saturated but in the visual image details on the moon are viewable. the moon is not in the ut images.,1
497,there are a number of philosophical questions that i would like to ask if we encounter a life form during our space exploration how do we determine if we should capture it imprison it and then discect it if we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly will we expend resources from earth to help them with all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought back or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere have a day,1
498,exit,1
499,it's not quite what you were asking but a few years ago i helped some ee remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of ice they used the sky for a background calibration source. they said that from earth's surface the sky looks like a k blackbody.,1
500,i know that alot of how people think and act in a long distance space project would be much like old tiem explorers sailors hunters and such who spent alot of time alone isolated and alone or in minimal surroundings and sopcial contacts.. such as the old arctic and antarctic expeditions and such.. i vote for a later on sci.space.medicine or similar newsgroup fro the discussion of long term missions into space and there affects on humans and such..,1
501,i'm not sure if this is a big issue but it seems to me like it might be up till now all g forces applied to the mirror and its mounting and nearly all g forces have been applied along the telescope's optical axis and against the mirror's base. reentry would apply forces along roughly the same axis but tending to pull the mirror away from the mount and the landing would apply onedge forces to both the mirror and mount. it could be that one or both of these would not survive. greg,1
502,it should be noted that the us benefitted not only from german science and technology after ww but also from british science and technology. from the discovery and manufacture of penicillin to jet engines swing wing aircraft the hovercraft etc etc. all were shipped lockstickandbarel across the atlantic. we still are suffering from this sort of thing because of some of the more parochial aspects of us procurement policy. meiko a british parallel computer company for example has now moved most of its facilities to the us since that was the only way it could sell stuff over there.,1
503,having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft i had assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function. however i always find disturbing the oxymoron of a noop command that does something. if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not a noop command. of course this terminology comes from a jet propulsion laboratory which has nothing to do with jet propulsion.,1
504,sorry i've lost track of who asked the question originally our news server at gsfc keeps things around for tremendously short periods of time but wanted to be certain before i replied. someone asked about displaying the compressed images from the voyager imaging cdroms on a mac. as peter ford mit pointed out a decompression program is available via ftp. sorry i don't remember the name of the node offhand although it's .mit.edu. in any case though one of the mac display programs cd rom browser by dana swift does display the compressed images directly. the program is shareware and is distributed by nssdc for nominal reproduction costs shipping if memory serves. this does not cover the shareware price which should go to dana for his diligent work and upgrades however. to request current pricing information information about available display software catalogs or data from nssdc contact our user support office at national space science data center coordinated request and user support office cruso mail code nasagoddard space flight center greenbelt md phone fax,1
505,i hate to belabor the obvious once again but if there had been an orbiter emergency in the early stages of the original hst deployment mission they would have had to land with hst in the bay. indeed they were worried about that. one concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up and make orbit but one that was too low to give hst a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag. i believe the decision was to deploy hst even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months. in fact we got an excellent orbit on the upper envelope of what the shuttle can do. i have never heard of any serious consideration that hst might be brought down for refurbishment. you would have the horrendous cost of transporting cleaning retesting and recertifying all the hardware on the ground in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time. and you would probably still need a third servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out. better to have two servicing missions in space which could well happen than to bring hst down and take it up again.,1
506,no no no the previous one was called smiley. qb smiley and fw karla. note that neither name is official. it seems the discoverers have an aversion to the designation scheme.,1
507,well it's not that simple you're in earth's magnetic field and you don't generate electricity but it can be done. the way you power things is with electricity so the answer to the first question is definitely yes. if you meant to say propel rather than power the answer is sort of. yes you can use interaction with the earth's magnetic field to get electrical power and there are potential applications for this. however bear in mind that there is no free lunch. the energy isn't coming from nowhere. what such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy. there are cases where this is a useful tradeoff. using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations however. what you can do is get your power by some other means e.g. solar arrays and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse pumping energy into the orbit rather than taking energy out of it. if you want more information trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion tether applications and magsails. no. a dragless satellite does not magically have no drag it burns fuel constantly to fight drag maintaining the exact orbit it would have if there was no drag. this is why there are quotes around dragless.,1
508,basically the right question although i was interested in cases closer to home where the sun is behind either a natural object or effective shielding. good point and thanks for the references.,1
509,indeed so it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible. it is possible only because mount everest is at a fairly low latitude there is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere beyond what is induced by the earth's rotation thanks to the overall circulation pattern of the atmosphere air cools at poles and descends flowing back to equator where it is warmed and rises and this helps just enough to make everest withoutoxygen feasible. only just feasible mind you the guys who did it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation and probably incurred some permanent brain damage.,1

511,fc exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big fc visable light telescopes from what i've seen or less fc down from amlost years ago. that sounds like dying fc to me... that doesn't seem like a fair comparison. infrared astronomy didn't really get started until something like yrs. ago it didn't explode until iras in . gammaray and i think xray observations didn't really get started until the 's. i believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in general and i know that extreme uv short of angstroms observations until the euve launched last year had almost no history except a few observations on skylab in the 's. twentyfive years ago the vast majority of astronomers only had access to optical or radio instruments. now with far more instruments available growth in some of these new fields has resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of total astronomical work. fc that would be true if adaptive optics worked well in the visable. fc but take a look at the papers on the subject they refer to anything fc up to microns as visable. i don't know about you but most fc people have trouble seeing beyond microns or so... there are fc reasons to think adaptive optics will not work at shorter fc wavelengths without truely radical improvements in technology. hmm some of the folks in this department planning on using adaptive optics at the m at palomar for nearinfrared observations and microns might be surprised to hear this. and isn't the ntt already pushing toward . arcsecond resolution from a groundbased site remember . arcseconds was one of the selling points of hst.,1
512,think for a moment about the technology required to do that. by the time they could make the earth's sky look like las vegas the people could afford to go backpacking on the moon. round trip costs for kg to the moon would be about the same as kg in a low earth advertising orbit very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard therefore. if such ads were to become common place that would have to be a very low price... the night sky on a lunar backpacking trip would still be very pristine... there's always been a problem of having to get away from civilization before you can really find natural scenery. years ago this usually didn't take a trip of over miles. today most people would have to go miles or more. if we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit that essentially means that no place on earth is still wild. while that may or may not be a good thing the orbital billboards aren't the problem they are just a symptom of growing denselypopulated civilization. banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky because by the time such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights where you can see the stars... an ad on a moon of jupiter would be rather pointless since you need a telescope to see them. however i'd love to see them get all the publicity they could from underwritting the coca cola io orbital mapping probe. they already can to some extent the iau allows names derived from sponsors or patrons of scientific research. if microscum donates money to a university astronomy program one of the galactic astronomers could easily get a newly discovered galaxy named after them.,1
513,come on this is sci.space. an orbital billboard won't do any permanent damage in a few years it will reenter and probably hit los angles anyway the boost to space commerce orbital advertising might provide might speed the day it is possible for those with a yen for dark skies to get some really dark skies beyond the dust producing the zodiacal light. now if they wanted to paint the cocacola symbol on the moon in lampblack that would give me pause. it would be very difficult to reverse such a widespread application of pigments.,1
514,using greenhouses to extend the growing season shouldn't be a problem. i'm supprised they don't do so in alaska cheaper to import perhaps no the incas had no problems with this but the spanish did.,1
515,well pat for once i agree with you and i like your first idea that you had. it probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar spacecraft well it makes as much sense as some things. i was at the first gamma ray burst conference here at uah and had great fun watching the discomfiture of many of the gamma ray scientists. much scruitiny was given to the data reductions. i remember one person in particular who passionately declared that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the phenomena of the smooth sky distribution. heck it even shoots down the warp transition theory . the next conference is soon and i will endeavour to keep in touch with this fun subject.,1
516,it is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some believe that poor old new mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business. for many reasons it can and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not. the 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect the state of new mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port. the commanding general at wsmr is in full support of dualuse for the facilities. the wsmr location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project. just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospaceequivalent of vaporware by inviting folks out to kick nonexistent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch don't think that nothing has happened. from my interactions with the macdac folks i get the impression that they want to set a firm believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar. i believe that all will happen this summer and don't worry the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur. stephen horan shorannmsu.edu,1
517,i don't think that idea means what you think it does. having everyone on earth subject to some ad agency's poor taste is an abomination. abomination n. loathing odious or degrading habit or act an object of disgust. oxford concise dictionary maybe you don't mind having every part of your life saturated with commercials but many of us loathe it. i'd rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred by a giant billboard and i'll bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious to an astronomer like sagan.,1
518,sorry you have a wish for an uncluttered night sky but it isn't a right. when you get down to it you actually have no rights that the majority haven't agreed to give you and them in the process. it's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with rights to this that and the other. sadly this is not true. now if you want to talk about the responsibility that should go with the power to clutter the night sky then that's a different matter.,1
519,doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more propulsion capability than we can manage. you would have to boost to pluto and then slow back down. you could do something like a hohman orbit but i think that would take ridiculous amounts of time my rubber bible is at home. insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world. mary shafer nasa ames dryden,1
520,idea for repair of satellites warning i am getting creative again why not build a inflatable space dock. basically deploy one side of the space dock using a scissor shaped structure saw it on beyond then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it.. the inflate the dock with a gas is does not have to be oxygen just neeeds to be nonflameble nondamaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat thenheat the space dock for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit but a much striped down own.. i know this might take a slot of work or not or just to plain wierd but ideas need to be thought of for where is tomorrow but in the imagination of the present..,1

522,what evidence indicates that gamma ray bursters are very far away given the enormous power i was just wondering what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic ranges . . . david gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic 'edged' distribution to whit they are either part of the universe or part of the oort cloud. why couldn't they be earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge of the gravisphere i know there isn't any mechanism for them but there isn't a mechanism for the others either. what on earth is the gravisphere anyway before it's decay the pioneer venus orbiter had a gamma ray detector as does ulysses they detect the brightest bursts that the earth orbit detectors do so the bursts are at least at oort cloud distances. in principle four detectors spaced out by a few au would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin. the problem with oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. it would have to involve new physics as far as i can tell. closest to conventional oort sources is a model of bfield pinching by comets it's got too many holes in it to count but at least it was a good try...,1
523,not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for the mother ship that can't be applied to the probes. otherwise it's better to simply launch the probes independently. the outer planets are scattered widely across a twodimensional solar system and going to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one. uranus is not on the way to neptune. don't judge interplanetary trajectories in general by what the voyagers did they exploited a lineup that occurs only every couple of centuries and even so voyager took a rather indirect route to neptune. solar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system. they're also very slow unless you assume quite advanced versions.,1
524,could someone please help me. i am trying to find the address to the tdrs receiving station at white sands missile range. i am interested in possible employment and would like to write for information.,1
525,we've been progressing towards that goal for years now. we precede any orbiting mission with flyby missions. of course it gets harder to do as we work our way farther away from earth. we're just starting to work out to the outer planets galileo will orbit jupiter and cassini around saturn.,1
526,you should have heard prof. mcnally from my days as an astronomy undergraduate denouncing photon pollution. it was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside mill hill observatory with a gauge shotgun however seriously it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights by adding a reflector so that the light only illuminates the ground which is after all where you need it. as a bonus the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. strangely enough astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems with considerable success in the desert areas around the major us observatories. at least thats what mcnally told us all those years ago. british local authorities couldnt care less as far as i can see i suppose that the right to dark skies is no more than an aspiration but it is a worthwhile one. illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky and are presumably in the area of international law if any although i do find the idea of a right to bear antisatellite weapons intriguing.,1
527,well imho and i am just a nobody net.user henry spencer is to sci. as kibo is to alt. and rec..... ....but i could be wrong...did anybody mention the illuminati kitten,1
528,of course how many government projects after using pert gant c.p.m.s process flow diagrams level software projects.... actually come in on schedule and under cost. i know the gao determined that of all nasa projects miss their budgets due to failing to adequately measure engineering developement costs. me i am allin favor of government rd. i thought bell labs was one of the best to do research. i don't think the government should pour money into any one sector but should engage in projects which naturally push the state of the art. things like high tech construction projects apollo was worth it for the doing. running hte national labs. the ssc is grossly overweight but is a reasonable project at a lower cost. unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected. maybe what they should do is throw out much of the process and just tell new ph'ds you get a time grant of . if you produce you can qualify for other grants. if you don't you never get in again. this way young people get a shot at reserach and older stale scientists don't dominate the process.,1
529,the most current orbital elements from the norad twoline element sets are carried on the celestial bbs and are updated daily when possible. documentation and tracking software are also available on this system. as a service to the satellite user community the most current elements for the current shuttle mission are provided below. the celestial bbs may be accessed hoursday at or bps using data bits stop bit no parity. element sets also updated daily shuttle elements and some documentation and software are also available via anonymous ftp from archive.afit.af.mil ... in the directory pubspace. sts u a . . . . . . .,1
530,has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this mission you seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence. pat this would be slower more expensive and worse. slower the shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in december. that's less than eight months away. there is no way you could build new hardware retrain and reschedule the eva's in that time. more expensive your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the oms. in addition you've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware. according to a gao report on the omv i have before me there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle hst and axaf. since axaf has since been scaled back and hst can rely on the shuttle there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.,1
531,stuff deleted the french spot is an example that comes to mind. although the company name escapes me at the moment sells images worldwide you can bet your last dollar franc that the french gov't gets first dibs. i remember a few years ago about the time spot was launched i was speaking to my dad an usaf officer about this and that and i happend to mention spot i think we were talking about technology utilization. he just about went ballistic. he wanted to know how i knew about spot and just what i knew. i guess that space surveillance is such a sensitive topic in the air force that he couldn't believe that i would read about such a system in the popular press ie. av week. mark,1
532,mike adams suggested discussions on longterm effects of spaceflight to the human being. i love this topic as some of you regulars know. so having seen henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk about it i shall. i feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and probably more. i do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society. in the absence of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the world's space effort. just a few contributions from the space program to regular society . calculators . teflon so your eggs don't stick in the pan . pacemakers kept my grandfather alive from until p.s. to all the regular contributors to sci.space.news and sci.space.shuttle thanks for all your hard work keeping us informed as to the doings down in nasa and other spacetype agencies. i don't have much time to read usenet but i always read these two groups....,1

534,correction and some more info the kaliningrad that mr. larrison writes about is indeed near moscow. i've read that it may also be known by the name podlipk and is a short distance from zvezdny gorodok star city and the cosmonaut training center there. i read that the tsniimach central scientific research institute of machine building est. enterprise was also responsible for creating the nkik ground command and measurement complex including the kaliningrad flight control center which has controlled all sovietrussian manned spaceflights since its completion in . however it appears to have been a part of the ministry of general machine building which was not part of the military ministry of defense but would have been a part of the militaryindustrial complex.,1

536,space ad proposed this is undoubtedly the sickest thing to come down the marketing pipe in years and the best reason for resurrecting the star wars killer satellite system.,1
537,in space digest v ...about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit mr. hathaway's post is right on the money if a little lengthy. in short an orbiting billboard would be trash in the same way that a billboard on the earth is trash. billboards make a place look trashy. that is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use. the light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky. regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect since they are more like abstract entities but a billboard in space would be like a beer can somebody had thrown on the side of the road just trash.,1
538,well almost. it turns out that clever orbital mechanics can engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order harmonics of the earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of months to years. my favorite example of this is the sovietrussian heavy elint satellites of the cosmos class which are in resonance. in particular c has undergone two periods of prolonged gain in altitude the current one having started in june the mean altitude of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on march . looking at the elements for c also shows the limitations of norad's software but that's another story. this probably has little relevance to space stations since the degree orbits of the c satellites are at km which is unacceptably far into the inner van allen belt for manned platforms. but it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the situation. orbital elements for these satellites are available on request. allen thomson saic mclean va,1

540,i'd hardly call the current pluto fast flyby proposal too large if the new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds the sc mass will drop to kg or too expensive million fy for two sc especially when compared to other nasa planetary missions. this proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and the require minimal deltav from the mother ship. a mission to the main belt might be one possibility for such a mission i recall a paper being presented at an aiaa deisgn conference in irvine in february where such a proposed spacecraft was designed by some grad students at ut austin i think. four minispacecraft would detatch from the main sc each visiting a seperate asteroid and then returning to the main sc. after analysis the main sc would then be targeted for the most interesting object for further study. now if i could only find that paper...,1

542,this is a good question. there are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable. for example why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does the naive answer is photosynthesis but this is clearly incomplete. photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten. what is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material. on earth this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter mostly from oceanic sources. however this burial requires continental sediments in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered. this suggests that a planet without large oceans or a planet without continents undergoing weathering will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere. in particular an allocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere. there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time for a period at least orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o to weathering in the absence of replenishment. no convincing feedback mechanism has been identified. perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle if during the last myr or so the oxygen level had dropped too low we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it.,1

545,.. one thing to recall. putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. coming back to not only that altitude but matching the position of it in its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing. any misalignment of the plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will require more fuel to adjust. this was considered in the original deployment. i agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous. one has to admire how much they are trying to do.,1

551,you can do a whole hell of a lot better than or degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network. ignore the directional information from batse just look at the time of arrival. with three detectors properly arranged one can often get positions down to arc minutes. btw about oort cloud sources shouldn't this be testable in the fairly near future some of the grbs have very short rise times ms. we could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of bt c where b is the detector spacing and t the time resolution. for t ms and b au this is on the order of light years. i understand statistics will reduce this number considerably as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction.,1

575,weve had the the great western the dunno and the great northern postulated as brunels masterpiece. keep boxing the compass chaps youll get round to it eventually. the great western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. the great eastern which broke the 'little giant' financially and otherwise was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design. a thirty thousand ton all steel vessel with primary steam propulsion it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built. brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale while drag rose with the square so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling. unfortunately there was no real market for such a beast at the time and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. as another poster said it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship. it was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections. see arthur c clarkes book how the world was one i think thats right if thats how the shuttle goes down in history as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder it would not be entirely ignoble but i doubt if history will be so charitable. its true the shuttle can do things no other launch system can do but are they worth doing with low cost access to space you could have an affordable space station for doing shuttlelike extended manned missions. as it is the shuttle is not so much a spacetruck as a spacerv only not so cheap to run,1
576,no the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch. indeed this dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed to the arrayflapping problems. the retrieval problems are exactly as stated it would be costly would involve extensive downtime and the worry of someone finding a reason not to relaunch it and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.,1
577,we can only say that they are beyond about au due to the low accuracy of position determination by single detectors. it may be a new physics problem i.e. a problem involving new physics. however the data is not good enough to rule out the models which use old physics. new physics is a big step and is only tolerated when there is no alternative. for example the dark matter problem there's more to the universe than meets the eye is a question of comparable mystery to grbs but we have much better data regarding it. theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an experimentalist or several detects them in the lab.,1

579,the problem with oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. it would have to involve new physics as far as i can tell. closest to conventional oort sources is a model of bfield pinching by comets it's got too many holes in it to count but at least it was a good try... so you have a plausible model for grb's at astronomical distances recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis which had a lot of problems anyhow. we have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models. a paper on the possibility of grb's in the oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service. to get a copy of this paper send a message to astrophbabbage.sissa.it with the subject line get here is the abstract of that paper. the currently favored explanation for the origin of grbs puts them at cosmological distances but as long as there is no distance indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. this is why the oort cloud of comets is kept on the list although there is no known mechanism for generating grbs from cometary nuclei. unlikely as it may seem the possibility that grbs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved. we use the available data on the distribution of grbs the batse catalogue up to march and the catalogue of cometary orbits by marsden and williams to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of grbs and comets' aphelia assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect at least to some extent true variations in the column density of the oort cloud. we also apply the vov test to both distributions.,1
580,having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft i had assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function. however i always find disturbing the oxymoron of a noop command that does something. if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not a noop command. using your argument the noop operation in a computer isn't a noop since it causes the pc to be incremented. of course this terminology comes from a jet propulsion laboratory which has nothing to do with jet propulsion. of course the complaint comes from someone who hasn't a clue as to what he's talking about. carl j lydick internet carlsol.gps.caltech.edu nsihepnet solcarl,1

582,... also as implied by other posters why do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway ... you don't need to but it's desirable. hst like all satellites in low earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag. it was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason. it needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter. it has no propulsion system of its own. has any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the hst yet give it a push i can see the push start cartoons now .,1
583,why not build a inflatable space dock. if you're doing largescale satellite servicing being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense. the question is whether anyone is going to be doing largescale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justifying development of such a thing. that's a mighty fine idea. but since you asked why not i'll respond. putting aside the application of such a space dock there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume. temperature control is difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation maybe a doublewalled inflatable. micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required. don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble it's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multilayer fabric that softtorso space suits are made out of today. because almost all manned space vessels skylab mir salyut used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity even though they had have metal skins they still kind of qualify as inflatable. the inflation process would have to be carefully controlled. the space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials due to temperature extremes monotomic oxygen impingement and radiation effects on materials so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long. this may not matter. even after inflation pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases. these are some of the technical difficulties which the llnl proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success. ken jenks nasajscgm space shuttle program office kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov,1
584,i have to agree with ward. the problem with your approach is they add up what you can reasonably claim as 'spinoffs' add up what's been spent on space and then come back with something like you spent x billion for that wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on direct research and forget all this space stuff we could have got all that stuff a lot cheaper that way. space is wasteful and inefficient. then they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of new guinea tribesmen or something. insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world. mary shafer nasa ames dryden,1

595,wm hathaway comments i agree that the desire for beauty is valid but i think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not. you mention the ageold desire to somehow get up there but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision. you mention the beauty of a very dark sky not impeded by the effects of humans but ignore the beauty of the asdarkascanbe sky that is only visible from space a vision that we or at least our descendents may one day be able to see in part because of efforts that others call ugly. one day i hope humans will be able to look out not upon half the heavens with only naturecreted lights but upon all of the heavens with no lights. if advertising in space can help us reach that goal it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear or yestercentury which is totally unreachable. one of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form in the effort of striving to reach a goal. i don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that just because it has changed the way we strive. btw there are places that people haven't fouled. sometimes they make it better. tommy mac tom mcwilliams wk as the radius of vision increases tmibm.cl.msu.edu hm the circumference of mystery grows.,1

599,i have mb worth uuencode'd gif images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative space station designs being considered in crystal city. ... i just posted the gif files out for anonymous ftp on server ics.uci.edu. you can retrieve them from ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeode.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeodea.gif ics.uci.eduincominggeodeb.gif the last two are scanned color photos the others are scanned briefing charts. these will be deleted by the ics.uci.edu system manager in a few days so now's the time to grab them if you're interested. sorry it took me so long to get these out but i was trying for the ames server but it's out of space. but now i need to clarify the situation. the incoming directory on ics.uci.edu does not allow you to do an ls command. the files are there i just checked on at cdt and you can get them don't forget the binary mode but you can't ls in the incoming directory. a further update mark's design made the cover of space news this week as one of the design alternatives which was rejected. but he's still in there plugging. i wish him luck using et's as the basis of a space station has been a good idea for a long time. may the best design win. ken jenks nasajscgm space shuttle program office kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov,1
600,hans as somebody replied on whether the space shuttle is connected to hans usenet no. of course the main flow of information would be up hans unless henry spencer would be aboard in which case the main hans flow of information would be down. gene miya says that henry will never go aloft in the shuttle the payload bay isn't big enough for his chocolate chip cookies. when henry was here at dryden he was looking pretty covetously at the srs and the fs even though they don't have much cookie space. i guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight....,1
601,and most definitely read it in conjunction with heinlein's starship trooper. the two books are radically different viewpoints of the same basic premises. i've even heard tell of english classes built around this. insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world. mary shafer nasa ames dryden,1

603,for some reasons we humans think that it is our place to control everything. i doubt that space advertising is any worse than any other kind advertising but it will be a lot harder to escape and is probably the most blatant example yet of our disregard for the fact that we are not in fact creaters of the universe. annoying little species aren't we,1
604,i don't know what you mean by 'edged' but surely there are two other possibilities for an isotropic distribution near interstellar up to pc i.e. within the disc or the galaxy's corona,1

606,well there are several bursts in species diversity i can think of. the cambrian and ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity. likewise after the onetwo punch of the permian and triassic extinctions the number of marine animals rose steadily to an alltime high just prior to the spread of humans. biggest exception being the kt bye bye dinos extinction about families also plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps. mosses colonized very wet environments first ferns who had evolved vascular tissues took over more territory when they evolved . these were eventually mostly replaced by gymnosperms pines and the like and then mostly displaced by angiosperms flowering plants now the dominant plant group on the planet. fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. around the carboniferous up to about families around the triassic up to maybe families starting in the cretaceous rising to about families currently it's unclear to me at least what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold and if it has ever hit this in the past. it could be warning speculation alert that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down. this would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were. see cowen's book history of life for a nottootechnical rundown on well like the title sez the history of life. or see wilson's diversity of life for a view centered more on current ecology this is imho the best popular biology book of what the hell i'll say it all time. followups to t.o.,1
607,. please take this out of sci.space. . ayn rand was not only born in russia but educated there. a lot of her philosophy reflects not only a european education but a reaction against certian events in russia while she lived there. i've heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy between the continental and britishamerican schools rand belongs in the former in terms of methodology et al even though she was trying to say things that would belong in the latter school. i.e. she was trapped in the language of kant and hegel even though she was trying to say at times much different things.,1
608,sorry to split hairs but i just read in the making of the atomic bomb that teflon was developed during world war . a sealant was needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was gradually enriched by difussion. uf is very corrosive and some very inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals. alejo hausner hausnerqucis.queensu.ca,1
609,only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it since the prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort. you can spend a billion pretty quickly buying titan launches. what's more if you buy titans the prize money is your entire return on investment. if you develop a new launch system it has other uses and the prize is just the icing on the cake. i doubt very much that a billiondollar prize is going to show enough return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current us launchers. there would surely be a buyamerican clause in the rules for such a prize since it would pretty well have to be governmentfunded. you're going to have to invest your front money in building a new launch system rather than pissing it away on existing ones. being there first is of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it. i'm sure spar would offer to develop such a lunartuned system and deliver a couple of them to you for only a couple of hundred million dollars.,1
610,a yes but the improvement in boost orbit to the hst is significant and that means you can then carry edo packs and enough consumables so the shuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the array tilt motors and god knows what else is going to wear out on the hst in the next months.,1
611,you've got it. what you regard as a right someone else will regard as a privilege. followups to some generic ethics and morality newsgroup ....,1
612,i am sure your numbers are far better then mine. as i said above i don't have exact numbers. how different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug be from that of the shuttle and it's oms engines i know that no small manuevering tug exists but maybe one could soup up a bus . does anyone out there have the declasified specs on hte bus would it be able to provide enough control force to balance the hst and still have the rocket thrust to hurl her into a decent high orbit sorry that should be intrument pointing. plus if the second box gets fritzy you could be in shitter ville real fast. the problem is noone seems to have the exact numbers. when the mission was planned originally at spacewalks and astronauts there was enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight. they have now planned for eva's an day mission and have reserve eva's and an emergency eva. obviously that is coming from somewhere. my guess is the oms burn fuel or reboost margin. i just figured if goldin wants to really prove out faster cheaper better have some of the whiz kids slap together an expendable space manuevering tug out of a bus and use that for the reboost. it has to be better then using the discovery as a tow truck.,1
613,i don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landinglaunch in terms of stressesmisalignmentsetc. i would think of the reboost as a gentile push where a landing then launch as two jolts which would put more mechanical stress on the instruments. additionally there might be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden landing. finally probably some thought went into possible contamination problems if the instruments came back to earth. of course the cost of two shuttle launches is a good reason to avoid something that might be done in one shuttle launch. here's hoping cepi's gang gets the job done right the first time.,1
614,yes just take money from the profitable commercial enterprises and give it to the government to redistribute. government is so much more efficient trustworthy and noble than selfserving businesses. let's nip this redistributionist ignorance in the bud. if it were not for commercial enterprises the whole world would be starving.,1
615,yes a flotation tank combined with floride breathing waterref the abyss breathing solution i think.. also the right position of the astronaut and strapping you can probably get much more than gs in an accesloration.. more like near g or somewhat less.. saw i book called the time master i thjink that was the title that had some ideas on how fast and all you could go..,1
616,well we already suffer from street hoardings. if you don't watch tv you are free of commercials there but if you want to go from a to b you cannot escape beer ads. i think the right time to stop this proposal is now. if this idea goes through it's the thin end of the wedge. soon companies will be doing larger and more permanant billboards in the sky. i wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky looks like las vegas. that would really make me sad. coca cola company will want to paint the moon red and white. well if not this moon then a moon of jupiter. microscum will want to name a galaxy microscum galaxy'. where do we draw the line historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines. i'm normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource allocation for space research i think it's the most important investment possible for mankind in the long run. but this is not the way to get the money. ans.,1

618,much of cook's later exploration was privately funded by joseph banks among others eg in resolution the earlier endeavour. colnett's voyage to the galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of british whaling vessels. chancellor and willoughby were privately funded by london merchant companies in their voyages to muscovy. the list is almost endless. those doing the funding were about eighty percent motivated by potential profit ten percent by potential glory and ten percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge.,1
619,you don't need to but it's desirable. hst like all satellites in low earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag. it was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason. it needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter. it has no propulsion system of its own. this is an excellent opportunity given that there may not be another visit for several years.,1
620,if this idea goes through it's the thin end of the wedge. soon companies will be doing larger and more permanant billboards in the sky. i wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky looks like las vegas. that would really make me sad. think for a moment about the technology required to do that. by the time they could make the earth's sky look like las vegas the people could afford to go backpacking on the moon. round trip costs for kg to the moon would be about the same as kg in a low earth advertising orbit very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard therefore. if such ads were to become common place that would have to be a very low price... this is nonsense. its like saying that by the time commercials on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own hour long nationally broadcast tv program. there's always been a problem of having to get away from civilization before you can really find natural scenery. years ago this usually didn't take a trip of over miles. today most people would have to go miles or more. if we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit that essentially means that no place on earth is still wild. while that may or may not be a good thing the orbital billboards aren't the problem they are just a symptom of growing denselypopulated civilization. banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky because by the time such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights where you can see the stars... the rest of your post is strange mishmash of its already really bad and it doesn't really matter if it gets worse. you should try to figure out what you are really arguing for. kneejerk antienviron mentalism david,1
